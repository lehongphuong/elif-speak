I think it may rain."," It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."," That would be weird."," Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."," I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."," Yes, it would be. "," I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. "," Me too. I can't wait until winter."," I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."," I'd rather be cold than hot."," Me too."," It doesn't look very nice outside today."," You're right. I think it's going to rain later."," In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."," That wouldn't seem right."," Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."," Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot."," I know, you're absolutely right."," I wish it would cool off one day."," That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon."," I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."," I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot."," That's exactly how I feel."," I wish it was a nicer day today."," That is true. I hope it doesn't rain."," It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer."," It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now."," It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather."," Any rain right now would be pointless."," That's right, it really would be."," I want it to cool down some."," I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter."," Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though."," I would rather deal with the winter than the summer."," I feel the same way."," It's such a nice day."," Yes, it is."," It looks like it may rain soon."," Yes, and I hope that it does."," Why is that?"," I really love how rain clears the air."," Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains."," Yes, but I love the night air after it rains."," Really? Why is it?"," Because you can see the stars perfectly."," I really hope it rains today."," Yeah, me too."," Isn't it a nice day?"," It really is."," It seems that it may rain today."," Hopefully it will."," How come?"," I like how clear the sky gets after it rains."," I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains."," I especially love the night air when it rains."," Really? Why?"," The stars look so much closer after it rains."," I really want it to rain today."," Yeah, so do I."," Don't you think it's nice out?"," Yes, I think so too."," I think that it's going to rain."," I hope that it does rain."," You like the rain?"," The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it."," I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner."," I love most how it is at night after it rains."," How come?"," You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains."," I would love for it to rain today."," I would too."," I really want to go to the beach this weekend."," That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?"," I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend."," Is it going to be perfect beach weather?"," I believe so."," Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend."," I know. I really want to go to the beach."," But you know that California weather is really unpredictable."," You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold."," I really wish the weather would just stay the same."," I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time."," Yeah, that would make things a lot easier."," I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend."," A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?"," The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend."," So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?"," It sounds like it will be."," I really hope it doesn't get cold."," That would ruin things, I want to go so badly."," The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know."," That is true. The weather is constantly changing."," It would be nice if the weather would never change."," That would be great, then we could plan things sooner."," True. Predictable weather would make life easier."," It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend."," What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too."," The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm."," Will it be good beach weather?"," I think it will be."," It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend."," I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm."," I know. Every day the weather seems different."," I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable."," That would make it easier for us to make plans."," I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like."," Have you seen the new girl in school?"," No, I haven't."," She's really pretty."," Describe her to me."," She's not too tall."," Well, how tall is she?"," She's about five feet even."," What does she look like, though?"," She has pretty light brown eyes."," I may know which girl you're talking about."," So you have seen her around?"," Yes, I have."," There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?"," I haven't seen her yet."," I think that she is very pretty."," Tell me how she looks."," She's kind of short."," What height is she?"," She's probably about five feet."," That's nice, but tell me what she looks like."," The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes."," I think I might've bumped into her before."," Are you telling me that you've seen her before?"," I believe so."," Have you met the new girl?"," No. Have you?"," She's one of the prettiest girls at the school."," What does she look like?"," Well, she's quite short."," How tall would you say that she is?"," I would say she's only five feet."," What about her facial features?"," She has light brown eyes, absolutely beautiful."," I think I know who you're talking about."," Have you seen her?"," I think that I have."," Why weren't you at school yesterday?"," I wasn't really feeling well."," What was wrong with you?"," My stomach was upset."," Do you feel better now?"," I don't really feel too well yet."," Do you want anything to make you feel better?"," No, thanks. I already took some medicine."," I hope you feel better."," Thank you."," What reason do you have for missing school?"," I was sick."," How were you sick?"," I had a stomachache."," Did it get any better?"," I'm still feeling under the weather."," Would you like anything for your stomach?"," I took something earlier."," Get better."," Thanks a lot."," Why didn't you go to school yesterday?"," I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well."," What was your problem?"," My stomach was bothering me."," Are you feeling any better?"," I'm still feeling a little sick."," I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?"," That's okay."," I hope you feel better."," I'd appreciate that."," Did you hear the good news?"," No, I haven't."," I got a promotion at my job."," Did you really?"," Seriously, I am so excited."," Well, congratulations."," Thank you."," I'm so happy for you."," Really?"," Yes. You really deserved this."," You think so?"," Yes. Good for you."," Have you heard my good news?"," You haven't told me anything yet."," I got a promotion at work earlier this week."," Is that right?"," It's the truth. I am really happy."," Congratulations on your promotion."," Thank you very much."," I am really excited for you."," Are you really?"," I'm serious. You deserved this promotion."," Is that what you really think?"," Yes, I do."," I haven't told you what happened yet, have I?"," I haven't heard anything."," My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it."," Are you serious?"," Yes, I am really excited."," That's great. Congratulations."," I appreciate that."," You have no idea how happy I am for you."," For real?"," I believe you were the best choice for that promotion. I really do."," You look really nice today. "," Thank you. I just got this outfit the other day."," Really, where did you get it?"," I got it from Macy's."," It's really nice."," Thanks again. You look nice today, too."," Thank you. I just got these shoes today."," Really? What kind of shoes are they?"," These are called All Star Chuck Taylors."," I really like those. How much did they cost?"," They were about forty dollars."," I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair."," I absolutely love what you're wearing today."," You do? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago."," Seriously, it looks really nice on you. Where did you buy it from?"," I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall."," I really like that outfit."," Thanks. I think you look nice today, too."," Thank you.

They just need to find it."," What's your favorite movie?"," My favorite movie is Superbad."," Oh, why is that?"," It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen."," That's true. It is a very funny movie."," You've seen it before? "," Yes, I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters."," Didn't you laugh through the whole movie? I did."," Me too. That movie brought tears to my eyes."," Mine too."," I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it."," Sure, let's go."," Which movie is your favorite to watch?"," I have to say, my favorite movie is Superbad."," Is that right?

Why didn't anyone tell me?"," I would've thought that somebody would have told you."," No, I had no idea."," Well, she did, her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces."," Oh my God, that's great!"," Are you going to go and visit her and the baby?"," I think that I might."," Good!

Why?"," I really want to go to the movies this weekend."," So go then."," I really don't want to go by myself."," Well anyway, do you plan on going to school tomorrow?"," No, I think I'm going to go to the movies."," Did you make it to school today?"," I always do. Did you go to school today?"," No, I didn't."," You should have, but have you seen any movies lately?"," That was an odd change of subject."," Maybe it was, but answer the question."," No, not recently."," I want to go to see a movie this weekend."," What's stopping you then?"," I don't want to go alone."," So, will you be at school tomorrow?"," No, I want to go to the movies instead."," Did you even bother to go to school today?"," Yeah, I went. Did you go?"," No, I didn't feel like it."," That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?"," No, but that was a random change of subject."," It may have been random, but have you?"," I haven't lately."," I would love to catch a movie this weekend."," So then, why don't you just go?"," I don't want to see a movie by myself."," Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?"," I think I might just go to the movies."," Thanks for coming to see me today."," It's no problem. I was really missing you anyway."," I missed you too."," Why haven't you tried to come see me then?"," I've been really busy."," Doing what?"," Working."," I would've come to see you sooner, but I've been busy too."," What have you been doing?"," I've been working too."," Well regardless, I'm very happy that you came to see me."," I am too."," I'm really glad that you came to see me."," I had to.

I think it may rain."," It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."," That would be weird."," Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."," I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."," Yes, it would be. "," I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. "," Me too. I can't wait until winter."," I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."," I'd rather be cold than hot."," Me too."," It doesn't look very nice outside today."," You're right. I think it's going to rain later."," In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."," That wouldn't seem right."," Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."," Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot."," I know, you're absolutely right."," I wish it would cool off one day."," That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon."," I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."," I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot."," That's exactly how I feel."," I wish it was a nicer day today."," That is true.

Why is it?"," Because you can see the stars perfectly."," I really hope it rains today."," Yeah, me too."," Isn't it a nice day?"," It really is."," It seems that it may rain today."," Hopefully it will."," How come?"," I like how clear the sky gets after it rains."," I feel the same way.

Did you go?"," No, I didn't feel like it."," That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?"," No, but that was a random change of subject."," It may have been random, but have you?"," I haven't lately."," I would love to catch a movie this weekend."," So then, why don't you just go?"," I don't want to see a movie by myself."," Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?"," I think I might just go to the movies."," Thanks for coming to see me today."," It's no problem.

I just want to know."," Well, it's really none of your business."," That's harsh."," I'm sorry, but I have to go."," Fine."," I've enjoyed conversing with you."," Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast?"," I've got to go."," I wasn't done talking to you."," I have to do some things, and besides, it's not polite to be nosey."," I'm not being nosey. I'm just asking."," I really don't think it's any of your business."," That's not nice."," I apologize, but I'm getting off the phone now."," Okay."," I'll talk to you later."," What's the rush?"," I have to get off the phone now."," I'm not ready to get off the phone with you."," There are other things I need to take care of."," What is it that you need to do? "," Please don't be nosey."," I'm not being nosey, it's just a question."," You don't need to worry about that."," That was mean to say."," I am very sorry, but I must go."," I guess."," Well, it was nice talking to you."," It was nice talking to you too."," We should really hang out again."," That would be fun."," Where do you want to go?"," I think we should go out to eat."," That sounds good."," All right, so I'll see you then."," I'll call you later."," Okay, I'll talk to you later then."," See you later."," Bye."," I enjoyed talking to you."," I enjoyed talking to you too."," We should hang out some time."," I think that would be nice."," Is there anything you would like to do next time?"," Do you want to go out to eat?"," I'd like that."," So I'll see you next time."," I'm going to call you soon.

I think it may rain."," It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today."," That would be weird."," Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside."," I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside."," Yes, it would be. "," I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. "," Me too. I can't wait until winter."," I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."," I'd rather be cold than hot."," Me too."," It doesn't look very nice outside today."," You're right. I think it's going to rain later."," In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining."," That wouldn't seem right."," Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird."," Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot."," I know, you're absolutely right."," I wish it would cool off one day."," That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon."," I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes."," I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot."," That's exactly how I feel."," I wish it was a nicer day today."," That is true. I hope it doesn't rain."," It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer."," It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now."," It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather."," Any rain right now would be pointless."," That's right, it really would be."," I want it to cool down some."," I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter."," Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though."," I would rather deal with the winter than the summer."," I feel the same way."," It's such a nice day."," Yes, it is."," It looks like it may rain soon."," Yes, and I hope that it does."," Why is that?"," I really love how rain clears the air."," Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains."," Yes, but I love the night air after it rains."," Really? Why is it?"," Because you can see the stars perfectly."," I really hope it rains today."," Yeah, me too."," Isn't it a nice day?"," It really is."," It seems that it may rain today."," Hopefully it will."," How come?"," I like how clear the sky gets after it rains."," I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains."," I especially love the night air when it rains."," Really? Why?"," The stars look so much closer after it rains."," I really want it to rain today."," Yeah, so do I."," Don't you think it's nice out?"," Yes, I think so too."," I think that it's going to rain."," I hope that it does rain."," You like the rain?"," The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it."," I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner."," I love most how it is at night after it rains."," How come?"," You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains."," I would love for it to rain today."," I would too."," I really want to go to the beach this weekend."," That sounds like fun.

That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time."," Yeah, that would make things a lot easier."," I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend."," A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?"," The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend."," So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?"," It sounds like it will be."," I really hope it doesn't get cold."," That would ruin things, I want to go so badly."," The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know."," That is true. The weather is constantly changing."," It would be nice if the weather would never change."," That would be great, then we could plan things sooner."," True. Predictable weather would make life easier."," It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend."," What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too."," The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm."," Will it be good beach weather?"," I think it will be."," It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend."," I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm."," I know. Every day the weather seems different."," I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable."," That would make it easier for us to make plans."," I know.

I already took some medicine."," I hope you feel better."," Thank you."," What reason do you have for missing school?"," I was sick."," How were you sick?"," I had a stomachache."," Did it get any better?"," I'm still feeling under the weather."," Would you like anything for your stomach?"," I took something earlier."," Get better."," Thanks a lot."," Why didn't you go to school yesterday?"," I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well."," What was your problem?"," My stomach was bothering me."," Are you feeling any better?"," I'm still feeling a little sick."," I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?"," That's okay."," I hope you feel better."," I'd appreciate that."," Did you hear the good news?"," No, I haven't."," I got a promotion at my job."," Did you really?"," Seriously, I am so excited."," Well, congratulations."," Thank you."," I'm so happy for you."," Really?"," Yes.

"," Please don't be nosey."," I'm not being nosey, it's just a question."," You don't need to worry about that."," That was mean to say."," I am very sorry, but I must go."," I guess."," Well, it was nice talking to you."," It was nice talking to you too."," We should really hang out again."," That would be fun."," Where do you want to go?"," I think we should go out to eat."," That sounds good."," All right, so I'll see you then."," I'll call you later."," Okay, I'll talk to you later then."," See you later."," Bye."," I enjoyed talking to you."," I enjoyed talking to you too."," We should hang out some time."," I think that would be nice."," Is there anything you would like to do next time?"," Do you want to go out to eat?"," I'd like that."," So I'll see you next time."," I'm going to call you soon.

"," I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. "," Me too. I can't wait until winter."," I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold."," I'd rather be cold than hot."," Me too."," It doesn't look very nice outside today."," You're right.

How about you?"," I only got here this year."," You like it so far?"," It's OK."," I can tell you don't really like it."," It'll get better after I finish my General Education."," I understand what you mean."," Could you help me?"," What do you need?"," I can't seem to find my class."," What building is it in?"," It's in the C building."," Oh, I know exactly where that is."," Do you think you can tell me where it is?"," Sure, what room number is it?"," It's room number 261."," I have a class around there right now."," Could you show me where it is?"," No problem, come on."," Excuse me, I need your assistance."," Sure, what's up?"," I have no idea where my class is."," Tell me which building it's in."," My class is in the C building."," I know where the C building is."," Do you mind telling me where it is?"," Of course, which room number is it?"," Number 261."," I actually have a class right around there."," Can you please show me?"," I can do that."," Do you mind helping me?"," What can I help you with?"," I'm not sure how to find my next class."," Do you know what building that it's in?"," The C building, I think."," Well, that's not far away."," Could you point me in that direction?"," Do you know what the room number is?"," It's C261."," My next class is around there."," Can you show it to me?"," Sure, let's go."," How do I buy my textbooks?"," Do you have your book list for your class?"," Yes, I have my list."," Yes, I know where the bookstore is."," No, I didn't know I could do that."," Yes, I am going today."," Yes, thank you. That would be great."," Well, then, I'll talk to you later. Have a good day!"," Where can I buy textbooks?"," First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that?"," Yes, I have that."," No, I don't know where the bookstore is."," Really? How can I do that?"," No, I can't make it today."," No, thanks. I'm good."," I'll see you later then. Have a great day!"," Can you help me buy my textbooks?"," No, I don't have that."," I am not sure where the bookstore is."," Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?"," I think maybe I could be there."," Maybe that would work."," I'll catch you later then. Have a wonderful morning."," Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller?"," Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?"," Yes, but I have never taken his class before."," He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?"," Yes, that's what I need."," Yes, I guess so."," Yes, I had a teacher like that before."," Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?"," No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing."," Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes. Are you in his class?"," I'm thinking of taking his class next semester."," He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?"," Yes, I really need someone who is really good."," Maybe, but I'm not sure."," Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?"," No, that stuff isn't important to me."," Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?"," I don't care about any of that."," Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?"," I'm thinking about taking his class next semester."," He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?"," I really need to learn this stuff."," Yes, that sounds right for me."," Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?"," Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing."," Professor, could I make an appointment with you?"," Two o'clock would be the best time."," Fine, do you know where my office is?"," No, I'm not sure."," Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor."," I see."," Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then."," I'll see you then."," Looking forward to meeting with you!"," Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you?"," I would like to come in at three o'clock."," I am glad that that works out; can you find my office?"," Yes, I can."," I got it."," If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way."," Thank you, I'll be there."," If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!"," Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you?"," Three would be a good time."," Great, do you need directions to my office?"," I'm not sure."," OK, I'll find it."," It's very easy to find."," See you then."," I will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!"," Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done."," What happened that you didn't get it done?"," I had to watch a football game instead."," Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?"," Yes, I think so."," Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?"," I'll make it up next week."," Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an �A� in the class."," OK, I can do that."," Remember that you are in college now, not high school."," I don't have my homework today."," You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?"," I was really sick."," But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?"," Yes, I probably could."," You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?"," Next class meeting."," That would work for me."," Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student."," Let me tell you what happened to my homework."," OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?"," Actually, I did it, but then it got lost."," Could you have gotten it done at another time?"," Yes, I could."," I'll make it up early next week."," That would work, but don't let it happen again."," I'll try."," That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again."," Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score."," I think that the percentage is incorrect."," Let's just go over all of it to double-check."," Sure, let's do it."," I don't see any mistakes."," OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score."," Yes, let's total it."," Yes, you're right."," I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher."," Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?"," I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right."," That would be great!"," This one right here should be right."," Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?"," Yeah, let's do the math."," Looks pretty good."," Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!"," Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong."," What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?"," Both."," Yeah, I'm ready."," These look strange."," OK, let's do the calculation."," We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage."," I see."," Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!"," Do you have the notes from last week's class?"," Did you come late?"," I couldn't make it."," Why is that?"," I was sick."," Oh, okay. Well, here you go."," Are these all of them?"," Oh, wait, here are the rest."," Thanks a bunch."," Don't mention it."," Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?"," Were you here last week?"," I was unable to make it."," How come?"," I was sick that day, and couldn't make it."," Well, here are the notes."," Are there any more?"," Sorry, here you go."," Thanks a lot."," No problem."," Let me get last week's notes."," Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?"," I couldn't come."," Why not?"," I wasn't feeling well."," Here they are."," Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?"," Oh, no, this is the rest."," Thank you very much."," It's no problem at all."," I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades."," What counts the most?"," Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation."," Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?"," What if we miss something?"," Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?"," You will be able to track your progress during the year."," What do you base our grades on?"," Does the final count the most?"," All of it is important; please just do your best at all times."," How do you total our scores?"," What if we are out sick?"," Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence."," How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?"," Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on."," How do you decide what grade we get?"," I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests."," What is the most important factor?"," How can we keep track of our grades?"," What if we can't get to school?"," You can only miss one class without penalty."," If we have a major problem, will you let us know?"," I'd like to talk to you about my grades."," Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?"," I am worried that I messed up on a test."," Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?"," I think I am doing great, except for that one test!"," I think that I could study a little harder for tests."," Yes, I know."," I'm sure you'll do fine."," Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?"," Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?"," Am I failing?"," Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?"," I am pretty sure that I am in trouble."," I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?"," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?"," I'll try; it's hard!"," Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?"," Of course, how can I help you?"," I want to know if I am doing OK."," Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?"," I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well."," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others."," I think I could take better notes and read a little more."," I'm working on it!"," Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement."," Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class."," Is this something that you could schedule for another time?"," No, I have to do this; it's important!"," Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?"," I've made arrangements with a friend to help me."," You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?"," Yes, I know."," Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me."," OK, I can do that."," Well, have a good day off from class."," Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting."," Is this absolutely necessary?"," I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class."," Will you be able to make up the work you missed?"," I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading."," Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester."," Yes, I remember."," Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?"," Sure, no problem."," Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!"," I have to miss school next week."," Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?"," Unfortunately, this is what I have to do."," How are you going to catch up?"," I've got it all covered."," If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester."," Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss."," Make sure to remind me right before you are absent."," I'll remember."," Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!"," Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today."," What is the problem?"," I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative."," Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?"," Yes, I've got that part covered."," When, exactly do you need to leave?"," I don't need to leave until the very end of class."," Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again."," Thanks, Professor. See you later!"," See you later! Drive carefully."," Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early."," Why do you have to leave early?"," I am not feeling well."," Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?"," Yes, it's all taken care of."," Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?"," I can stay a few more minutes."," OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed."," Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!"," Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again."," I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class."," Where do you need to be that is more important than school?"," I have an appointment."," Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?"," No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work."," Are you going to go right away?"," I am leaving right now."," All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up."," Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of."," Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school."," I have an appointment for 1:30."," What can I help you with?"," Well, I have a problem with my class schedule."," What is it?"," It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time."," I can understand the problem with that."," Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?"," No problem, do you want those classes still?"," Yes, I do."," Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day."," Thank you very much. "," I'm here for my appointment."," What can I do for you today?"," I have an issue with my schedule."," Tell me the problem."," I have two classes on here that are at the same time."," Oh, I see."," Can you change that for me?"," Do you still want both classes?"," Yes, I would like to keep both classes."," I'll try to change one to a different day."," I would greatly appreciate that."," I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30."," Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?"," There's a problem with my schedule."," What's the problem?"," Two of my classes occur at the same time."," Well, I can see that's a problem."," Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?"," Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?"," I want to keep both of them, if that's possible."," Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day."," Thanks a lot."," I am unsure how to add a class and need help."," I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?"," Yes, I have an add sheet."," No, I'm not sure."," Thanks. I understand what to do now."," That sounds good."," Professor, can you help me add your class?"," You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?"," No, I will have to get an add sheet."," No, I don't know where that is."," I think I can find it."," Thank you for letting me add your class."," To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!"," I am not sure how to add a class."," Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? "," I'll bring one next time."," I think I know where it is."," Thank you for your directions. It's clear."," That's great. Thank you so much."," When are we leaving for our field trip?"," Yes, I will write that down."," Yes, I will be there on time."," We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?"," Yes, someone is coming to get me."," What should we bring with us?"," Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?"," Yes, I can write that on my calendar."," Yes, I understand."," No, I don't have a ride yet."," How much will the trip cost?"," What date will our field trip be on?"," Yes, I will make note of that."," Be there half an hour early."," Yes, someone is picking me up."," Not at the moment�maybe later, though."," Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?"," Sure! What kind of food would you like?"," I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe."," I know the perfect place!"," Good! Where is it?"," It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?"," That would be great."," Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!"," Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?"," Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?"," Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great."," Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat."," Is it close by?"," It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?"," OK, I'd love the company."," This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."," Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?"," I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?"," Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something."," I have a great idea of where you might like to go."," Can we walk there?"," It's on the second floor. May I join you?"," Of course! Let's go."," Let's hurry. I'm starving!"," Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?"," Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?"," I want to buy that candy."," Yeah, so far, so good."," Yeah, I already knew that."," OK, let's move on!"," I hope it works!"," Well, good luck!"," I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help."," Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?"," I want to buy a drink."," I've got the correct change already."," OK, what next?"," OK, next? "," I agree with you."," Hope that works for you!"," I want to know how to buy something from this machine."," Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?"," I want to buy one of those snack things."," Are you ready to go?"," I'm clear so far."," The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in."," It won't go in!"," Yes, next step."," They're totally unreliable."," You seem to have it down. Have a good day!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books."," Here they are."," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine."," I don't have the money right now."," What would happen if I didn't pay it?"," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that."," My library books are late, where can I put them?"," Yeah, I think that they are really late!"," Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books."," Here they are."," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine."," I don't have the money right now."," What would happen if I didn't pay it?"," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that."," My library books are late, where can I put them?"," Yeah, I think that they are really late!"," Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?"," Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?"," Yes, I understood the old one."," Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?"," Debit or credit card."," OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?"," Yes."," OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine."," Yes, I can do that."," Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also."," Yes, I'm ready."," All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard."," Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?"," It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?"," I never used a parking meter before."," Cash."," Fine, can you read the rate on the display?"," Yes, I can."," Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment."," I'd rather not pay, but I have to."," Perfect, let's do it."," Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have."," This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?"," It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added."," Yeah, OK."," I have coins."," Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?"," I didn't see that, but now I do."," Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in."," Here it goes!"," You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step."," I am a little confused."," Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!"," I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester."," Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?"," I am a daytime student."," Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?"," I will be driving my car."," OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?"," I'll pay for it with a check."," Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?"," No, thanks; I'm fine."," Here you go then. Have a great school year!"," I'll need a parking permit for next semester."," Do you attend school during the day or only at night?"," I only attend class part-time in the evenings."," Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile? "," I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school."," Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?"," I'll pay cash."," Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?"," No, thank you."," OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester."," I want to buy a parking permit, please."," Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?"," I attend both day and evening classes."," Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?"," I ride a motorcycle."," That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?"," I'll use a credit card, thank you."," Do you need a second permit for a car?"," No, just the motorcycle permit."," Fine, here it is and have a great semester!"," Can you tell me where I can park? "," Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?"," I drive an automobile."," Yes, I have seen those spots."," I park in the evenings."," Yes, I have seen those signs."," Yes, I know what the curb colors mean."," Where should I park?"," Do you have a car or motorbike?"," I drive a scooter"," No, I haven't seen those spots."," I park in the daytime. "," No, I have not seen the signs."," No, I don't know what the curb colors mean."," What is the best place to park?"," I drive a motorcycle."," I am not sure what a handicapped spot is."," I park days and evenings."," What signs?"," What curb colors?"," Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?"," First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?"," I was there too long."," Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?"," Yeah, I saw it."," You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs."," Yeah, I understand."," Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge."," Yeah, you're right."," Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again."," OK, I will."," Good luck!"," Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?"," Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?"," I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park."," Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?"," I could tell what I was supposed to do."," I guess not."," Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it."," Sure, if it will help."," Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something."," Sounds good!"," Give it your best shot; it might work."," I don't know how to fight a parking ticket."," Both."," Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?"," I was confused."," Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?"," If it might work, I'll go for it!"," I can see how that might work."," I could do that!"," Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket."],[" Hello, I need to register for a class."," What class are you trying to take?"," I want to take a Psychology class."," Well, there are only two classes open."," Can you tell me what days the classes are on?"," One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2:00 p.m. -

Are you going to be taking a class from him?"," Yes, but I have never taken his class before."," He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?"," Yes, that's what I need."," Yes, I guess so."," Yes, I had a teacher like that before."," Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?"," No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing."," Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes.

Are you thinking of taking a class with him?"," I really need to learn this stuff."," Yes, that sounds right for me."," Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?"," Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing."," Professor, could I make an appointment with you?"," Two o'clock would be the best time."," Fine, do you know where my office is?"," No, I'm not sure."," Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor."," I see."," Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there.

I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done."," What happened that you didn't get it done?"," I had to watch a football game instead."," Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?"," Yes, I think so."," Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?"," I'll make it up next week."," Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an �A� in the class."," OK, I can do that."," Remember that you are in college now, not high school."," I don't have my homework today."," You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?"," I was really sick."," But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?"," Yes, I probably could."," You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?"," Next class meeting."," That would work for me."," Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student."," Let me tell you what happened to my homework."," OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?"," Actually, I did it, but then it got lost."," Could you have gotten it done at another time?"," Yes, I could."," I'll make it up early next week."," That would work, but don't let it happen again."," I'll try."," That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again."," Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score."," I think that the percentage is incorrect."," Let's just go over all of it to double-check."," Sure, let's do it."," I don't see any mistakes."," OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score."," Yes, let's total it."," Yes, you're right."," I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher."," Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?"," I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right."," That would be great!"," This one right here should be right."," Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?"," Yeah, let's do the math."," Looks pretty good."," Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!"," Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong."," What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?"," Both."," Yeah, I'm ready."," These look strange."," OK, let's do the calculation."," We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage."," I see."," Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!"," Do you have the notes from last week's class?"," Did you come late?"," I couldn't make it."," Why is that?"," I was sick."," Oh, okay. Well, here you go."," Are these all of them?"," Oh, wait, here are the rest."," Thanks a bunch."," Don't mention it."," Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?"," Were you here last week?"," I was unable to make it."," How come?"," I was sick that day, and couldn't make it."," Well, here are the notes."," Are there any more?"," Sorry, here you go."," Thanks a lot."," No problem."," Let me get last week's notes."," Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?"," I couldn't come."," Why not?"," I wasn't feeling well."," Here they are."," Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?"," Oh, no, this is the rest."," Thank you very much."," It's no problem at all."," I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades."," What counts the most?"," Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation."," Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?"," What if we miss something?"," Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?"," You will be able to track your progress during the year."," What do you base our grades on?"," Does the final count the most?"," All of it is important; please just do your best at all times."," How do you total our scores?"," What if we are out sick?"," Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence."," How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?"," Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on."," How do you decide what grade we get?"," I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests."," What is the most important factor?"," How can we keep track of our grades?"," What if we can't get to school?"," You can only miss one class without penalty."," If we have a major problem, will you let us know?"," I'd like to talk to you about my grades."," Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?"," I am worried that I messed up on a test."," Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?"," I think I am doing great, except for that one test!"," I think that I could study a little harder for tests."," Yes, I know."," I'm sure you'll do fine."," Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?"," Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?"," Am I failing?"," Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?"," I am pretty sure that I am in trouble."," I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?"," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?"," I'll try; it's hard!"," Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?"," Of course, how can I help you?"," I want to know if I am doing OK."," Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?"," I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well."," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others."," I think I could take better notes and read a little more."," I'm working on it!"," Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement."," Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class."," Is this something that you could schedule for another time?"," No, I have to do this; it's important!"," Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?"," I've made arrangements with a friend to help me."," You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?"," Yes, I know."," Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me."," OK, I can do that."," Well, have a good day off from class."," Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting."," Is this absolutely necessary?"," I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class."," Will you be able to make up the work you missed?"," I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading."," Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester."," Yes, I remember."," Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?"," Sure, no problem."," Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!"," I have to miss school next week."," Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?"," Unfortunately, this is what I have to do."," How are you going to catch up?"," I've got it all covered."," If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester."," Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss."," Make sure to remind me right before you are absent."," I'll remember."," Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!"," Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today."," What is the problem?"," I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative."," Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?"," Yes, I've got that part covered."," When, exactly do you need to leave?"," I don't need to leave until the very end of class."," Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again."," Thanks, Professor. See you later!"," See you later! Drive carefully."," Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early."," Why do you have to leave early?"," I am not feeling well."," Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?"," Yes, it's all taken care of."," Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?"," I can stay a few more minutes."," OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed."," Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!"," Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again."," I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class."," Where do you need to be that is more important than school?"," I have an appointment."," Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?"," No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work."," Are you going to go right away?"," I am leaving right now."," All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up."," Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of."," Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school."," I have an appointment for 1:30."," What can I help you with?"," Well, I have a problem with my class schedule."," What is it?"," It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time."," I can understand the problem with that."," Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?"," No problem, do you want those classes still?"," Yes, I do."," Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day."," Thank you very much. "," I'm here for my appointment."," What can I do for you today?"," I have an issue with my schedule."," Tell me the problem."," I have two classes on here that are at the same time."," Oh, I see."," Can you change that for me?"," Do you still want both classes?"," Yes, I would like to keep both classes."," I'll try to change one to a different day."," I would greatly appreciate that."," I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30."," Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?"," There's a problem with my schedule."," What's the problem?"," Two of my classes occur at the same time."," Well, I can see that's a problem."," Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?"," Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?"," I want to keep both of them, if that's possible."," Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day."," Thanks a lot."," I am unsure how to add a class and need help."," I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?"," Yes, I have an add sheet."," No, I'm not sure."," Thanks. I understand what to do now."," That sounds good."," Professor, can you help me add your class?"," You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?"," No, I will have to get an add sheet."," No, I don't know where that is."," I think I can find it."," Thank you for letting me add your class."," To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!"," I am not sure how to add a class."," Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? "," I'll bring one next time."," I think I know where it is."," Thank you for your directions. It's clear."," That's great. Thank you so much."," When are we leaving for our field trip?"," Yes, I will write that down."," Yes, I will be there on time."," We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?"," Yes, someone is coming to get me."," What should we bring with us?"," Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?"," Yes, I can write that on my calendar."," Yes, I understand."," No, I don't have a ride yet."," How much will the trip cost?"," What date will our field trip be on?"," Yes, I will make note of that."," Be there half an hour early."," Yes, someone is picking me up."," Not at the moment�maybe later, though."," Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?"," Sure! What kind of food would you like?"," I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe."," I know the perfect place!"," Good! Where is it?"," It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?"," That would be great."," Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!"," Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?"," Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?"," Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great."," Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat."," Is it close by?"," It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?"," OK, I'd love the company."," This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."," Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?"," I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?"," Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something."," I have a great idea of where you might like to go."," Can we walk there?"," It's on the second floor. May I join you?"," Of course! Let's go."," Let's hurry. I'm starving!"," Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?"," Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?"," I want to buy that candy."," Yeah, so far, so good."," Yeah, I already knew that."," OK, let's move on!"," I hope it works!"," Well, good luck!"," I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help."," Sure, no problem.

"," I agree with you."," Hope that works for you!"," I want to know how to buy something from this machine."," Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?"," I want to buy one of those snack things."," Are you ready to go?"," I'm clear so far."," The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in."," It won't go in!"," Yes, next step."," They're totally unreliable."," You seem to have it down. Have a good day!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books."," Here they are."," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine."," I don't have the money right now."," What would happen if I didn't pay it?"," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that."," My library books are late, where can I put them?"," Yeah, I think that they are really late!"," Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place.

You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?"," Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?"," Yes, I understood the old one."," Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?"," Debit or credit card."," OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?"," Yes."," OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine."," Yes, I can do that."," Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also."," Yes, I'm ready."," All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard."," Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?"," It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?"," I never used a parking meter before."," Cash."," Fine, can you read the rate on the display?"," Yes, I can."," Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment."," I'd rather not pay, but I have to."," Perfect, let's do it."," Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have."," This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?"," It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added."," Yeah, OK."," I have coins."," Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?"," I didn't see that, but now I do."," Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in."," Here it goes!"," You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step."," I am a little confused."," Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!"," I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester."," Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?"," I am a daytime student."," Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?"," I will be driving my car."," OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?"," I'll pay for it with a check."," Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?"," No, thanks; I'm fine."," Here you go then. Have a great school year!"," I'll need a parking permit for next semester."," Do you attend school during the day or only at night?"," I only attend class part-time in the evenings."," Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile? "," I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school."," Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?"," I'll pay cash."," Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?"," No, thank you."," OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester."," I want to buy a parking permit, please."," Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?"," I attend both day and evening classes."," Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?"," I ride a motorcycle."," That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?"," I'll use a credit card, thank you."," Do you need a second permit for a car?"," No, just the motorcycle permit."," Fine, here it is and have a great semester!"," Can you tell me where I can park?

Are you going to be taking a class from him?"," Yes, but I have never taken his class before."," He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?"," Yes, that's what I need."," Yes, I guess so."," Yes, I had a teacher like that before."," Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?"," No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing."," Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes. Are you in his class?"," I'm thinking of taking his class next semester."," He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?"," Yes, I really need someone who is really good."," Maybe, but I'm not sure."," Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?"," No, that stuff isn't important to me."," Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?"," I don't care about any of that."," Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?"," I'm thinking about taking his class next semester."," He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?"," I really need to learn this stuff."," Yes, that sounds right for me."," Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?"," Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing."," Professor, could I make an appointment with you?"," Two o'clock would be the best time."," Fine, do you know where my office is?"," No, I'm not sure."," Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor."," I see."," Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there.

I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done."," What happened that you didn't get it done?"," I had to watch a football game instead."," Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?"," Yes, I think so."," Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?"," I'll make it up next week."," Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an �A� in the class."," OK, I can do that."," Remember that you are in college now, not high school."," I don't have my homework today."," You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?"," I was really sick."," But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?"," Yes, I probably could."," You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?"," Next class meeting."," That would work for me."," Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student."," Let me tell you what happened to my homework."," OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?"," Actually, I did it, but then it got lost."," Could you have gotten it done at another time?"," Yes, I could."," I'll make it up early next week."," That would work, but don't let it happen again."," I'll try."," That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again."," Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score."," I think that the percentage is incorrect."," Let's just go over all of it to double-check."," Sure, let's do it."," I don't see any mistakes."," OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score."," Yes, let's total it."," Yes, you're right."," I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher."," Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?"," I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right."," That would be great!"," This one right here should be right."," Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?"," Yeah, let's do the math."," Looks pretty good."," Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!"," Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong."," What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?"," Both."," Yeah, I'm ready."," These look strange."," OK, let's do the calculation."," We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage."," I see."," Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!"," Do you have the notes from last week's class?"," Did you come late?"," I couldn't make it."," Why is that?"," I was sick."," Oh, okay. Well, here you go."," Are these all of them?"," Oh, wait, here are the rest."," Thanks a bunch."," Don't mention it."," Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?"," Were you here last week?"," I was unable to make it."," How come?"," I was sick that day, and couldn't make it."," Well, here are the notes."," Are there any more?"," Sorry, here you go."," Thanks a lot."," No problem."," Let me get last week's notes."," Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?"," I couldn't come."," Why not?"," I wasn't feeling well."," Here they are."," Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?"," Oh, no, this is the rest."," Thank you very much."," It's no problem at all."," I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades."," What counts the most?"," Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation."," Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?"," What if we miss something?"," Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?"," You will be able to track your progress during the year."," What do you base our grades on?"," Does the final count the most?"," All of it is important; please just do your best at all times."," How do you total our scores?"," What if we are out sick?"," Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence."," How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?"," Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on."," How do you decide what grade we get?"," I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests."," What is the most important factor?"," How can we keep track of our grades?"," What if we can't get to school?"," You can only miss one class without penalty."," If we have a major problem, will you let us know?"," I'd like to talk to you about my grades."," Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?"," I am worried that I messed up on a test."," Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?"," I think I am doing great, except for that one test!"," I think that I could study a little harder for tests."," Yes, I know."," I'm sure you'll do fine."," Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?"," Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?"," Am I failing?"," Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?"," I am pretty sure that I am in trouble."," I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?"," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?"," I'll try; it's hard!"," Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?"," Of course, how can I help you?"," I want to know if I am doing OK."," Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?"," I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well."," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others."," I think I could take better notes and read a little more."," I'm working on it!"," Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement."," Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class."," Is this something that you could schedule for another time?"," No, I have to do this; it's important!"," Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?"," I've made arrangements with a friend to help me."," You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?"," Yes, I know."," Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me."," OK, I can do that."," Well, have a good day off from class."," Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting."," Is this absolutely necessary?"," I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class."," Will you be able to make up the work you missed?"," I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading."," Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester."," Yes, I remember."," Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?"," Sure, no problem."," Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!"," I have to miss school next week."," Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?"," Unfortunately, this is what I have to do."," How are you going to catch up?"," I've got it all covered."," If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester."," Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss."," Make sure to remind me right before you are absent."," I'll remember."," Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!"," Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today."," What is the problem?"," I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative."," Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?"," Yes, I've got that part covered."," When, exactly do you need to leave?"," I don't need to leave until the very end of class."," Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again."," Thanks, Professor. See you later!"," See you later! Drive carefully."," Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early."," Why do you have to leave early?"," I am not feeling well."," Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?"," Yes, it's all taken care of."," Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?"," I can stay a few more minutes."," OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed."," Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!"," Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again."," I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class."," Where do you need to be that is more important than school?"," I have an appointment."," Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?"," No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work."," Are you going to go right away?"," I am leaving right now."," All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up."," Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of."," Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school."," I have an appointment for 1:30."," What can I help you with?"," Well, I have a problem with my class schedule."," What is it?"," It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time."," I can understand the problem with that."," Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?"," No problem, do you want those classes still?"," Yes, I do."," Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day."," Thank you very much. "," I'm here for my appointment."," What can I do for you today?"," I have an issue with my schedule."," Tell me the problem."," I have two classes on here that are at the same time."," Oh, I see."," Can you change that for me?"," Do you still want both classes?"," Yes, I would like to keep both classes."," I'll try to change one to a different day."," I would greatly appreciate that."," I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30."," Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?"," There's a problem with my schedule."," What's the problem?"," Two of my classes occur at the same time."," Well, I can see that's a problem."," Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?"," Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?"," I want to keep both of them, if that's possible."," Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day."," Thanks a lot."," I am unsure how to add a class and need help."," I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?"," Yes, I have an add sheet."," No, I'm not sure."," Thanks. I understand what to do now."," That sounds good."," Professor, can you help me add your class?"," You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?"," No, I will have to get an add sheet."," No, I don't know where that is."," I think I can find it."," Thank you for letting me add your class."," To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!"," I am not sure how to add a class."," Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? "," I'll bring one next time."," I think I know where it is."," Thank you for your directions. It's clear."," That's great. Thank you so much."," When are we leaving for our field trip?"," Yes, I will write that down."," Yes, I will be there on time."," We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?"," Yes, someone is coming to get me."," What should we bring with us?"," Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?"," Yes, I can write that on my calendar."," Yes, I understand."," No, I don't have a ride yet."," How much will the trip cost?"," What date will our field trip be on?"," Yes, I will make note of that."," Be there half an hour early."," Yes, someone is picking me up."," Not at the moment�maybe later, though."," Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?"," Sure! What kind of food would you like?"," I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe."," I know the perfect place!"," Good! Where is it?"," It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?"," That would be great."," Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!"," Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?"," Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?"," Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great."," Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat."," Is it close by?"," It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?"," OK, I'd love the company."," This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."," Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?"," I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?"," Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something."," I have a great idea of where you might like to go."," Can we walk there?"," It's on the second floor. May I join you?"," Of course! Let's go."," Let's hurry. I'm starving!"," Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?"," Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?"," I want to buy that candy."," Yeah, so far, so good."," Yeah, I already knew that."," OK, let's move on!"," I hope it works!"," Well, good luck!"," I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help."," Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?"," I want to buy a drink."," I've got the correct change already."," OK, what next?"," OK, next? "," I agree with you."," Hope that works for you!"," I want to know how to buy something from this machine."," Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?"," I want to buy one of those snack things."," Are you ready to go?"," I'm clear so far."," The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in."," It won't go in!"," Yes, next step."," They're totally unreliable."," You seem to have it down. Have a good day!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books."," Here they are."," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine."," I don't have the money right now."," What would happen if I didn't pay it?"," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that."," My library books are late, where can I put them?"," Yeah, I think that they are really late!"," Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place.

You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?"," Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?"," Yes, I understood the old one."," Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?"," Debit or credit card."," OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?"," Yes."," OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine."," Yes, I can do that."," Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also."," Yes, I'm ready."," All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard."," Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?"," It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?"," I never used a parking meter before."," Cash."," Fine, can you read the rate on the display?"," Yes, I can."," Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment."," I'd rather not pay, but I have to."," Perfect, let's do it."," Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have."," This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?"," It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added."," Yeah, OK."," I have coins."," Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?"," I didn't see that, but now I do."," Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in."," Here it goes!"," You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step."," I am a little confused."," Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!"," I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester."," Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?"," I am a daytime student."," Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?"," I will be driving my car."," OK, that will be twenty-five dollars.

I am so unlucky--what can I do?"," Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?"," I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park."," Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?"," I could tell what I was supposed to do."," I guess not."," Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it."," Sure, if it will help."," Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something."," Sounds good!"," Give it your best shot; it might work."," I don't know how to fight a parking ticket."," Both."," Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?"," I was confused."," Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?"," If it might work, I'll go for it!"," I can see how that might work."," I could do that!"," Try it.

Are you going to be taking a class from him?"," Yes, but I have never taken his class before."," He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?"," Yes, that's what I need."," Yes, I guess so."," Yes, I had a teacher like that before."," Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?"," No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing."," Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes.

I like that, don't you?"," No, that stuff isn't important to me."," Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?"," I don't care about any of that."," Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?"," Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?"," I'm thinking about taking his class next semester."," He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?"," I really need to learn this stuff."," Yes, that sounds right for me."," Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?"," Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing."," Professor, could I make an appointment with you?"," Two o'clock would be the best time."," Fine, do you know where my office is?"," No, I'm not sure."," Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor."," I see."," Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there.

I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done."," What happened that you didn't get it done?"," I had to watch a football game instead."," Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?"," Yes, I think so."," Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?"," I'll make it up next week."," Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an �A� in the class."," OK, I can do that."," Remember that you are in college now, not high school."," I don't have my homework today."," You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?"," I was really sick."," But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?"," Yes, I probably could."," You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?"," Next class meeting."," That would work for me."," Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student."," Let me tell you what happened to my homework."," OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?"," Actually, I did it, but then it got lost."," Could you have gotten it done at another time?"," Yes, I could."," I'll make it up early next week."," That would work, but don't let it happen again."," I'll try."," That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again."," Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score."," I think that the percentage is incorrect."," Let's just go over all of it to double-check."," Sure, let's do it."," I don't see any mistakes."," OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score."," Yes, let's total it."," Yes, you're right."," I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher."," Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?"," I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right."," That would be great!"," This one right here should be right."," Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?"," Yeah, let's do the math."," Looks pretty good."," Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!"," Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong."," What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?"," Both."," Yeah, I'm ready."," These look strange."," OK, let's do the calculation."," We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage."," I see."," Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!"," Do you have the notes from last week's class?"," Did you come late?"," I couldn't make it."," Why is that?"," I was sick."," Oh, okay. Well, here you go."," Are these all of them?"," Oh, wait, here are the rest."," Thanks a bunch."," Don't mention it."," Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week?"," Were you here last week?"," I was unable to make it."," How come?"," I was sick that day, and couldn't make it."," Well, here are the notes."," Are there any more?"," Sorry, here you go."," Thanks a lot."," No problem."," Let me get last week's notes."," Yeah, sure--you didn't come to class that day?"," I couldn't come."," Why not?"," I wasn't feeling well."," Here they are."," Thanks a lot; are these all the notes?"," Oh, no, this is the rest."," Thank you very much."," It's no problem at all."," I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades."," What counts the most?"," Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation."," Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?"," What if we miss something?"," Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?"," You will be able to track your progress during the year."," What do you base our grades on?"," Does the final count the most?"," All of it is important; please just do your best at all times."," How do you total our scores?"," What if we are out sick?"," Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence."," How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?"," Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on."," How do you decide what grade we get?"," I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests."," What is the most important factor?"," How can we keep track of our grades?"," What if we can't get to school?"," You can only miss one class without penalty."," If we have a major problem, will you let us know?"," I'd like to talk to you about my grades."," Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?"," I am worried that I messed up on a test."," Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?"," I think I am doing great, except for that one test!"," I think that I could study a little harder for tests."," Yes, I know."," I'm sure you'll do fine."," Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?"," Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?"," Am I failing?"," Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?"," I am pretty sure that I am in trouble."," I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?"," Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right?"," I'll try; it's hard!"," Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?"," Of course, how can I help you?"," I want to know if I am doing OK."," Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?"," I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well."," I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others."," I think I could take better notes and read a little more."," I'm working on it!"," Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement."," Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class."," Is this something that you could schedule for another time?"," No, I have to do this; it's important!"," Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?"," I've made arrangements with a friend to help me."," You know that I only allow one absence per semester, don't you?"," Yes, I know."," Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me."," OK, I can do that."," Well, have a good day off from class."," Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting."," Is this absolutely necessary?"," I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class."," Will you be able to make up the work you missed?"," I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading."," Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester."," Yes, I remember."," Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?"," Sure, no problem."," Make good use of that day off; you'll only have one this semester!"," I have to miss school next week."," Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here?"," Unfortunately, this is what I have to do."," How are you going to catch up?"," I've got it all covered."," If you miss this class, you will have used up your quota for the semester."," Don't worry, this will be the last class I miss."," Make sure to remind me right before you are absent."," I'll remember."," Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!"," Professor, I am going to need to leave class early today."," What is the problem?"," I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative."," Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?"," Yes, I've got that part covered."," When, exactly do you need to leave?"," I don't need to leave until the very end of class."," Fine, but next time try and not have to miss class again."," Thanks, Professor. See you later!"," See you later! Drive carefully."," Excuse me, Professor, I have a problem and need to leave class early."," Why do you have to leave early?"," I am not feeling well."," Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?"," Yes, it's all taken care of."," Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?"," I can stay a few more minutes."," OK, but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed."," Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!"," Go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again."," I am sorry, but I can't stay until the end of class."," Where do you need to be that is more important than school?"," I have an appointment."," Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?"," No, but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work."," Are you going to go right away?"," I am leaving right now."," All right, but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up."," Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of."," Goodbye, and try not to miss any more school."," I have an appointment for 1:30."," What can I help you with?"," Well, I have a problem with my class schedule."," What is it?"," It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time."," I can understand the problem with that."," Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?"," No problem, do you want those classes still?"," Yes, I do."," Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day."," Thank you very much. "," I'm here for my appointment."," What can I do for you today?"," I have an issue with my schedule."," Tell me the problem."," I have two classes on here that are at the same time."," Oh, I see."," Can you change that for me?"," Do you still want both classes?"," Yes, I would like to keep both classes."," I'll try to change one to a different day."," I would greatly appreciate that."," I was supposed to meet with you at 1:30."," Yes, I see. What did you need to see me about?"," There's a problem with my schedule."," What's the problem?"," Two of my classes occur at the same time."," Well, I can see that's a problem."," Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?"," Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?"," I want to keep both of them, if that's possible."," Well, let me find you one of these classes on a different day."," Thanks a lot."," I am unsure how to add a class and need help."," I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?"," Yes, I have an add sheet."," No, I'm not sure."," Thanks. I understand what to do now."," That sounds good."," Professor, can you help me add your class?"," You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?"," No, I will have to get an add sheet."," No, I don't know where that is."," I think I can find it."," Thank you for letting me add your class."," To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!"," I am not sure how to add a class."," Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? "," I'll bring one next time."," I think I know where it is."," Thank you for your directions. It's clear."," That's great. Thank you so much."," When are we leaving for our field trip?"," Yes, I will write that down."," Yes, I will be there on time."," We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?"," Yes, someone is coming to get me."," What should we bring with us?"," Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is?"," Yes, I can write that on my calendar."," Yes, I understand."," No, I don't have a ride yet."," How much will the trip cost?"," What date will our field trip be on?"," Yes, I will make note of that."," Be there half an hour early."," Yes, someone is picking me up."," Not at the moment�maybe later, though."," Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch?"," Sure! What kind of food would you like?"," I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe."," I know the perfect place!"," Good! Where is it?"," It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?"," That would be great."," Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!"," Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?"," Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?"," Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great."," Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat."," Is it close by?"," It's down a block on the right; can I show you the way?"," OK, I'd love the company."," This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."," Let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?"," I'm hungry, too. What types of food sound good?"," Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something."," I have a great idea of where you might like to go."," Can we walk there?"," It's on the second floor. May I join you?"," Of course! Let's go."," Let's hurry. I'm starving!"," Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?"," Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?"," I want to buy that candy."," Yeah, so far, so good."," Yeah, I already knew that."," OK, let's move on!"," I hope it works!"," Well, good luck!"," I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help."," Sure, no problem.

Put your books down right here."," OK, here they are."," OK, here's the money."," I'm not sure."," Now I understand."," These books should have been turned in last week."," You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books."," Here they are."," Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine."," I don't have the money right now."," What would happen if I didn't pay it?"," Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that."," My library books are late, where can I put them?"," Yeah, I think that they are really late!"," Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents."," What if I can't pay it?"," Yeah, I get it."," That's not really fair!"," Can you help me with returning my late books?"," This is the right spot to pay your fee.

Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?"," Yes."," OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine."," Yes, I can do that."," Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also."," Yes, I'm ready."," All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard."," Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?"," It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?"," I never used a parking meter before."," Cash."," Fine, can you read the rate on the display?"," Yes, I can."," Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment."," I'd rather not pay, but I have to."," Perfect, let's do it."," Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have."," This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?"," It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added."," Yeah, OK."," I have coins."," Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?"," I didn't see that, but now I do."," Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in."," Here it goes!"," You are doing great!

Will it be at your house?"," The party will be at Jay's house out by the pool."," Will everyone be pitching in with some food?"," What should we wear?"," This is a pool party, so make sure to bring your bathing suit."," Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?"," That sounds great. Is it casual?"," That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up."," Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people."," That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?"," Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company."," Mr. Lee, would you and your wife be free next Friday night?"," It would be our pleasure to join you for dinner. What type of party is it?"," We've always wanted to have a formal dinner party."," I think we would enjoy that, especially our wives!"," Yes, you will know all of our guests."," I'll have to check with my wife, of course. Did you have something planned?"," I think we would enjoy that. Is it a formal affair?"," My wife insisted on having it be a formal dinner party this time."," We thought that inviting four other couples would make nice conversation."," I think we will enjoy being there. Will we know anyone?"," We are only inviting people from work."," Joe, how are you doing today?"," I am free that night, and a party sounds good."," Fine. It will be at my house. Do you know how to get there?"," I kind of know where you live, but could you e-mail me your address?"," I would really like to bring my friend Jake, if that would be OK."," Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine."," Would you like some help with the food?"," Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink."," Hi Joe, is everything going OK with you?"," I would love to come to your party!"," I am glad you are free.

The more the merrier!"," Can I bring anything?"," Hey Joe, how's it going?"," A party would be a perfect way to end the week!"," Good! Do you need my address?"," What would you like me to bring?"," I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday."," We have some fresh red roses."," How much are the roses?"," Twenty dollars per dozen."," That sounds like a good deal."," Yes, that is today's sale price."," I'll take a dozen."," Is there anything else you'd like to get?"," No, the roses will be fine."," I'm sure your wife will love them."," It's my wife's birthday, and I'm going to buy her some flowers."," Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses."," How much do the roses cost?"," They're only $20 a dozen."," That sounds good, since last year I paid $30."," Yes, you're saving money because they're on sale today."," I'll take a dozen of your most beautiful roses."," Could I interest you in anything else?"," No, I'll just give her the roses and a card."," She should be very pleased with these roses."," I need to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday."," Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays."," What would the roses cost me?"," You can get a dozen for only $20."," That's a price that I like."," You're in luck today because the roses are on sale."," I'll purchase the roses."," Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses?"," No, the roses are good enough."," These roses should make your wife very happy."," I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday."," Me, neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together?"," Yes, that would be good!"," We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests?"," If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading."," Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are."," Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert."," Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now."," Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift."," I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday."," Yes, that way we would have more money to spend."," Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel."," Maybe we could ask her roommate, Malia, who her favorite groups are."," Malia would be a great help. She has known Mary a long time."," Let's e-mail Malia and ask her for her suggestions."," I think that maybe Malia might like to contribute to this gift too."," Yes, two heads are better than one."," What does she like to do?

What a nice home!"," We enjoy it too!"," How long have you lived here?"," About four years now."," Well, it is very beautiful."," Ron, have a seat and I'll get us something to drink."," Good! I am really thirsty. You know it really is hot outside!"," I have lemonade, iced tea, and mango juice."," Mango juice would be perfect. Thank you!"," Hi Ron, please come in!"," Good to see you, Malia. I love your house!"," We are very lucky to be living in this house."," Have you lived here a long time?"," This was my parents' house, so I grew up here."," It seems to be perfect for you."," Come on in and see the kitchen, and I'll get us both something to drink."," Great! It's such a hot day today, isn't it?"," Would you like lemonade, iced tea, or mango juice?"," I would love a nice glass of lemonade."," Come right on in, Ron, and welcome to our home!"," It's so nice to see you, Malia.

If Julie could pass this plate down to you, we can dig in!"," Oh Ashley, your dinner looks delicious!"," Mango juice would be a good choice for me."," Julie can pour your drink for you. Can I offer you some chicken?"," Yes, that chicken looks yummy!"," Would you like some salad to go with your chicken?"," Yes, I would enjoy having some salad."," I have also prepared rice. Are you ready for some rice?"," Yes, chicken and rice are a favorite of mine."," Good! Julie, could you pass this plate to Joe so we can get started?"," Mary, it's good to see you!"," I am so glad that you decided to stop by!"," Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you."," Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink?"," Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty."," How about a little snack then?"," No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago."," Well then, how is your family?"," Everyone is doing great. My sister finally had her baby."," Mary, what a surprise!"," Your timing is perfect!"," It's been a long time since we've stopped by."," Mary, Josh, would either of you like something to drink?"," Thanks, but we really are fine."," Would you like a little snack?"," No, thanks. We are still full from lunch."," Is your family doing well?"," Mary, how have you been?"," I was just thinking about you yesterday!"," It's been ages since we had a chance to visit with you!"," Mary, please let me get the two of you something to drink."," Oh, please don't go to any trouble. We just stopped by for a visit."," Can I get you a little something to eat?"," We appreciate the offer, but we already ate."," So tell me, how is your family doing?"," Hi Julie, how are things going?"," Everything is great, Tad. How are you?"," I'm doing really well."," Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?"," That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee."," I thought that he was with Malia."," I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!"," Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well."," Hi Julie, how are you?"," Things are going good, Tad. How about you?"," Things have been going well for me."," Julie, do you know who that woman talking to Lee is?"," Isn't he with Malia?"," Malia dumped him. She ran off with a guy she met on vacation."," Lee was probably less than thrilled with that!"," He was kind of relieved. They had been having some problems."," Hi Julie, how have things been going for you?"," I'm good, Tad. How are things with you?"," Things couldn't be better right now."," Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa?"," What about his relationship with Malia?"," How did Lee feel about that happening?"," Their wedding was absolutely beautiful."," It really was. I want a wedding like that."," How much do you think they spent on their wedding?"," I think it might've cost them a nice chunk of change."," Do you want a big wedding like that?"," Not really. I'd rather have a small wedding."," I wouldn't want a small wedding."," Why not?"," I want my wedding to be big and memorable."," It can be small and memorable too."," Well, to each his own."," You are absolutely right."," Their wedding was just exquisite."," I know. Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that."," What do you think their budget was?"," It must have cost them a pretty penny."," Would you like to have a big wedding like they did?"," No. I think I would prefer a smaller wedding."," I want a big wedding."," How come?"," I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it."," Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable."," Whatever floats your boat."," That is correct."," Their wedding was so beautiful."," I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day."," How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?"," I think it cost them a lot of money."," Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?"," I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding."," Not me."," Why do you want a bigger wedding?"," I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember."," You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it."," Whatever flicks your Bic."," That is true."," Do you want to go to the beach tonight?"," Sure, which beach are we going to?"," I wanted to go to Malibu beach."," I like Santa Monica."," The water there looks so dirty."," I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica."," I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night."," Is Malibu beach nice?"," It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better."," So you want to go to Malibu?"," If that's okay with you."," Sure, let's go to Malibu."," What do you think about going to the beach tonight?"," I'd love to. Which beach?"," It's up to you, but I was thinking Malibu beach."," I really like Santa Monica beach."," But the water there doesn't look too clean."," I only go because of the pier."," The pier is really nice at night."," How is it at Malibu beach?"," I love Malibu beach, because it's so beautiful."," So is Malibu where you really want to go?"," Are you cool with that?"," Yeah, we can go to Malibu."," I want to go to the beach tonight."," That sounds like fun. Which one are you thinking about?"," I was thinking Malibu, unless there is another beach you want to go to."," How about Santa Monica?"," I don't really like that beach, as the water seems really dirty."," The only thing I like about that beach is the pier."," At night, the pier is absolutely beautiful."," What's it like at Malibu beach?"," I love that beach, because it's just so nice."," So we're going to Malibu?"," Well, if you don't want to go to Malibu, we can go to Santa Monica."," We can always go to Santa Monica another day."],[" Are you going to the party on Saturday?"," I was thinking about it.

Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?"," I'm a pretty neat person."," Are you a night owl or a day person?"," Early to bed, early to rise."," Finally, do you smoke?"," Actually, I quit smoking four years ago."," Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?"," Just one: Is there a parking lot?"," Unfortunately, you have to park in the street."," Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway."," Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in."," I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay."," No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow."," Hello. You've reached Albert."," I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room? "," Yes, very much so."," Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?"," Fire away."," I just want to make sure that we are compatible."," That's a good idea. We need to get along."," Do you like to party?"," I don't party, and I don't like people who do."," Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?"," One of my mottoes is to clean as you go."," Do you sleep in or rise early?"," I go to bed early, and I get up early."," And last, are you a smoker?"," I can't stand cigarette smoke."," Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?"," Only one. Where can I park my car?"," I hate to tell you, but it's street parking."," I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it."," Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in."," Will tomorrow be okay with you?"," That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow."," Hi, this is Albert."," Yes, more than you know."," I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?"," Ask away."," I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along."," Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates."," Is partying one of your priorities?"," I'm a student. I don't have time to party."," Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"," I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."," What time do you usually hit the sack?"," Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."," What about smoking?"," If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide."," Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?"," Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?"," I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street."," I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now."," Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here."," How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?"," Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day."," Hello, Albert speaking."," This is Jack.

We need to be compatible."," Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?"," I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life."," Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?"," Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat."," What kind of hours do you keep?"," The early bird gets the worm."," I hope you're not a smoker."," I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag."," Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?"," Just one question. What's the parking situation?"," I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it."," I can move in by tomorrow afternoon."," That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway."," Hello, Albert here. "," Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? "," Yes, I need a room badly."," Can I ask you a few questions?"," I'm an open book."," I want to make sure that we get along okay."," I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony."," Do you like to drink and party?"," I hate noise, and I hate loud people."," Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?"," A place for everything, and everything in its place."," Do you keep normal hours?"," I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news."," You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?"," Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world."," I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?"," Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?"," You're not going to like this. It's street parking only."," That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it."," I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow."," Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day."," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C."," Oh, hi, Hannah."," There is something wrong with my garbage disposal."," Exactly what's going on?"," When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence."," When did this happen?"," Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."," Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?"," No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it."," Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal."," Well, no one ever told me that."," Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?"," I don't have a key."," Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."," Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal."," Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP."," Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C."," Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from."," My garbage disposal refuses to work."," What happens when you turn on the switch?"," When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."," When did you first notice this?"," A week ago it started sounding different."," Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?"," I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."," Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough."," Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?"," Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."," What key?"," A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."," Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."," Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."," Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah."," Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"," My garbage disposal isn't working."," Can you be a little more specific?"," Nothing happens when I turn on the switch."," Do you remember how it started?"," about a week ago I noticed a new sound."," You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"," I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently."," That's interesting. I never heard that before."," Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?"," I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."," I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it."," I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over."," The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber."," If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."," Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."," Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."," Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"," My garbage disposal went south."," Does it turn at all?"," There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch."," Did it die suddenly?"," It started to make a weird sound last week."," You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"," Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."," Once a week might not be enough, huh?"," There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up."," Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."," How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?"," Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."," The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman."," It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not."," Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."," Hi, Hannah. What's up?"," I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket."," Is it dying, or is it dead?"," Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch."," Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?"," Last week I noticed that it sounded strange."," You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"," I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently."," You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?"," Try loosening it up by using the disposal key."," Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."," Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."," Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."," Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."," Yes, this is John Smith."," John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."," Great, what is it?"," The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you."," That's great.

That's wonderful news!"," Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in."," Fees? I don't remember anything about fees."," You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees."," So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit."," No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?"," Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when will I be able to move in?"," Move in on the first.

I don't know what to say."," Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees."," Fees, I don't remember anything about fees."," Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," Oh, yes, of course, those fees!"," All I need is your address, and the check will be in the mail pronto."," My address is 3035 E.

I think you know why I'm calling."," Oh, it's about the rent."," Yes, this is the second month in a row."," I thought there was a grace period."," There is no grace period in the rental agreement."," Oh, I guess I forgot."," Well, when can I expect the rent?"," You'll get it by Monday."," Don't forget the $50 late fee."," Is that in the rental agreement?"," The late fee is circled in red ink!"," Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement."," If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling."," Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row."," But I thought that I had a grace period."," I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period."," Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived."," Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent."," I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday."," Don't forget to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?"," How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!"," If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you."," Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please?"," Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling."," Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent."," Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late."," I thought you said there is a grace period."," Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place."," Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check."," I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday."," Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee."," I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement."," If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!"," I forget where I put my rental agreement."," One more late check, and you're looking at eviction."," Hello. This is Nicole."," This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling."," Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent."," Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month."," What happened to my grace period?"," Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month."," I guess I might be a little confused."," What day in the near future can I expect your check?"," My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday."," Remember to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?"," I seem to have lost my rental agreement."," Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling."," Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue."," What about my grace period?"," Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's."," I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future."," Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow."," Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee."," Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars."," Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee."," As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again."," I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted."," Hello, this is Betty."," Hi, Betty. Larry here.

Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please."," This apartment came with one, and I installed another one."," Are there fresh batteries in each of them?"," Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping."," Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by?"," If you're thirsty, you can grab a beer or soda out of my frig."," Thanks, but it'll only take me about two minutes to test them and leave."," Hi, this is Betty."," There was one when I moved in.

All I get is junk mail and bills."," Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys."," Sure, that'll be fine."," Okay. I'll see you Wednesday.

I've been an apartment manager for a long time."," I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key."," Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once."," To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either."," If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key."," No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills."," If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you."," Wednesday's fine. "," Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me."," Hi, Nicole.

Let me see what I can do."," I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key."," Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys."," On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either."," If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key."," No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway."," Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday."," Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday."," Hello? This is Jimmy in 309."," Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole.

I'll come by right now to look at the damage."," Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?"," You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly."," I'm glad to hear that.

Are you still interested?"," Yes, I am."," I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions."," Shoot."," I just want to be sure that we get along."," I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along."," Are you a party animal?"," Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person."," Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?"," I'm a pretty neat person."," Are you a night owl or a day person?"," Early to bed, early to rise."," Finally, do you smoke?"," Actually, I quit smoking four years ago."," Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?"," Just one: Is there a parking lot?"," Unfortunately, you have to park in the street."," Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway."," Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in."," I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay."," No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow."," Hello. You've reached Albert."," I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room? "," Yes, very much so."," Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?"," Fire away."," I just want to make sure that we are compatible."," That's a good idea. We need to get along."," Do you like to party?"," I don't party, and I don't like people who do."," Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?"," One of my mottoes is to clean as you go."," Do you sleep in or rise early?"," I go to bed early, and I get up early."," And last, are you a smoker?"," I can't stand cigarette smoke."," Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?"," Only one. Where can I park my car?"," I hate to tell you, but it's street parking."," I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it."," Great!

I'll see you tomorrow."," Hi, this is Albert."," Yes, more than you know."," I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?"," Ask away."," I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along."," Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates."," Is partying one of your priorities?"," I'm a student. I don't have time to party."," Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"," I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."," What time do you usually hit the sack?"," Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."," What about smoking?"," If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide."," Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?"," Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?"," I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street."," I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now."," Very good.

Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?"," Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat."," What kind of hours do you keep?"," The early bird gets the worm."," I hope you're not a smoker."," I can smell a cigarette from a mile away.

Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?"," Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?"," You're not going to like this. It's street parking only."," That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it."," I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow."," Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day."," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C."," Oh, hi, Hannah."," There is something wrong with my garbage disposal."," Exactly what's going on?"," When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence."," When did this happen?"," Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."," Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?"," No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it."," Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal."," Well, no one ever told me that."," Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?"," I don't have a key."," Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."," Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal."," Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP."," Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C."," Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from."," My garbage disposal refuses to work."," What happens when you turn on the switch?"," When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."," When did you first notice this?"," A week ago it started sounding different."," Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?"," I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."," Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough."," Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?"," Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."," What key?"," A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."," Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."," Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."," Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah."," Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"," My garbage disposal isn't working."," Can you be a little more specific?"," Nothing happens when I turn on the switch."," Do you remember how it started?"," about a week ago I noticed a new sound."," You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"," I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently."," That's interesting. I never heard that before."," Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?"," I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."," I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it."," I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over."," The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber."," If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."," Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."," Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."," Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"," My garbage disposal went south."," Does it turn at all?"," There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch."," Did it die suddenly?"," It started to make a weird sound last week."," You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"," Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."," Once a week might not be enough, huh?"," There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up."," Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."," How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?"," Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."," The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman."," It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not."," Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."," Hi, Hannah. What's up?"," I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket."," Is it dying, or is it dead?"," Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch."," Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?"," Last week I noticed that it sounded strange."," You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"," I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently."," You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?"," Try loosening it up by using the disposal key."," Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."," Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."," Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."," Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."," Yes, this is John Smith."," John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."," Great, what is it?"," The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you."," That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy."," Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees."," Fees, what kind of fees?"," You know.

That's wonderful news!"," Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in."," Fees? I don't remember anything about fees."," You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees."," So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit."," No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?"," Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when will I be able to move in?"," Move in on the first.

That's the news I was hoping to hear!"," Before you move in, of course, you have to pay some fees."," Fees, I'm confused. What fees are you talking about?"," You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent."," Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else."," Just give me your address, and I'll mail the check today."," You can send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when can I start packing? When can I move in?"," Very good!

I think you know why I'm calling."," Oh, it's about the rent."," Yes, this is the second month in a row."," I thought there was a grace period."," There is no grace period in the rental agreement."," Oh, I guess I forgot."," Well, when can I expect the rent?"," You'll get it by Monday."," Don't forget the $50 late fee."," Is that in the rental agreement?"," The late fee is circled in red ink!"," Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement."," If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling."," Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row."," But I thought that I had a grace period."," I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period."," Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived."," Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent."," I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday."," Don't forget to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?"," How could you miss the late fee?

I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling."," Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent."," Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late."," I thought you said there is a grace period."," Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place."," Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check."," I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday."," Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee."," I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement."," If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!"," I forget where I put my rental agreement."," One more late check, and you're looking at eviction."," Hello. This is Nicole."," This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling."," Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent."," Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month."," What happened to my grace period?"," Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month."," I guess I might be a little confused."," What day in the near future can I expect your check?"," My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday."," Remember to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?"," I seem to have lost my rental agreement."," Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling."," Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue."," What about my grace period?"," Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's."," I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future."," Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow."," Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee."," Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars."," Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee."," As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again."," I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted."," Hello, this is Betty."," Hi, Betty. Larry here.

Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday."," Hello? This is Jimmy in 309."," Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?"," Maybe you can get me out of a small jam."," Well, I can certainly try."," Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key."," Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys."," I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either."," If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key."," Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday."," Not a problem.

Good for you! What is it?"," I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College."," Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?"," No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English."," I was worried that you were moving because of your neighbors."," Whoever my next neighbor is cannot possibly be as loud as those people."," I'm going to give them 30 days' notice if they don't turn that TV down."," Thanks for everything. I'll give you the keys on the thirtieth."," You've been a very good tenant.

Where can I park my car?"," I hate to tell you, but it's street parking."," I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it."," Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in."," Will tomorrow be okay with you?"," That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow."," Hi, this is Albert."," Yes, more than you know."," I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?"," Ask away."," I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along."," Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates."," Is partying one of your priorities?"," I'm a student. I don't have time to party."," Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"," I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."," What time do you usually hit the sack?"," Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."," What about smoking?"," If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide."," Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?"," Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?"," I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street."," I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now."," Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here."," How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?"," Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day."," Hello, Albert speaking."," This is Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?"," Oh, yes."," Would you mind answering a couple of questions?"," No problem."," Since we might be roommates, I want to make sure there's no friction."," You are right. We need to be compatible."," Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?"," I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life."," Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?"," Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat."," What kind of hours do you keep?"," The early bird gets the worm."," I hope you're not a smoker."," I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag."," Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?"," Just one question. What's the parking situation?"," I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it."," I can move in by tomorrow afternoon."," That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway."," Hello, Albert here. "," Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? "," Yes, I need a room badly."," Can I ask you a few questions?"," I'm an open book."," I want to make sure that we get along okay."," I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony."," Do you like to drink and party?"," I hate noise, and I hate loud people."," Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?"," A place for everything, and everything in its place."," Do you keep normal hours?"," I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news."," You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?"," Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world."," I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?"," Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?"," You're not going to like this. It's street parking only."," That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it."," I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow."," Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day."," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C."," Oh, hi, Hannah."," There is something wrong with my garbage disposal."," Exactly what's going on?"," When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence."," When did this happen?"," Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."," Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?"," No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it."," Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal."," Well, no one ever told me that."," Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?"," I don't have a key."," Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."," Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal."," Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP."," Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C."," Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from."," My garbage disposal refuses to work."," What happens when you turn on the switch?"," When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."," When did you first notice this?"," A week ago it started sounding different."," Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?"," I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."," Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough."," Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?"," Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."," What key?"," A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."," Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."," Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."," Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah."," Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"," My garbage disposal isn't working."," Can you be a little more specific?"," Nothing happens when I turn on the switch."," Do you remember how it started?"," about a week ago I noticed a new sound."," You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"," I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently."," That's interesting. I never heard that before."," Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?"," I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."," I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it."," I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over."," The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber."," If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."," Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."," Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."," Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"," My garbage disposal went south."," Does it turn at all?"," There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch."," Did it die suddenly?"," It started to make a weird sound last week."," You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"," Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."," Once a week might not be enough, huh?"," There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up."," Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."," How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?"," Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."," The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman."," It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not."," Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."," Hi, Hannah. What's up?"," I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket."," Is it dying, or is it dead?"," Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch."," Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?"," Last week I noticed that it sounded strange."," You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"," I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently."," You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?"," Try loosening it up by using the disposal key."," Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."," Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."," Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."," Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."," Yes, this is John Smith."," John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."," Great, what is it?"," The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you."," That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy."," Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees."," Fees, what kind of fees?"," You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit."," Oh, those fees!"," No problem, what's your address?"," Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when can I move in?"," The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys."," Very good! Let me have your phone number."," Sure.

That's wonderful news!"," Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in."," Fees? I don't remember anything about fees."," You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees."," So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit."," No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?"," Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when will I be able to move in?"," Move in on the first.

That's the news I was hoping to hear!"," Before you move in, of course, you have to pay some fees."," Fees, I'm confused. What fees are you talking about?"," You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent."," Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else."," Just give me your address, and I'll mail the check today."," You can send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when can I start packing? When can I move in?"," Very good! Now all I need is your phone number."," Call my office anytime at 626-555-3000."," Yes, I'm John Smith. What can I do for you? "," Hi, John. This is Terry Evans here. Do you want some good news?"," Sure, let me have it."," The apartment owner likes you. He approved your rental application."," Wow, that's fantastic! I don't know what to say."," Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees."," Fees, I don't remember anything about fees."," Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," Oh, yes, of course, those fees!"," All I need is your address, and the check will be in the mail pronto."," My address is 3035 E.

I think you know why I'm calling."," Oh, it's about the rent."," Yes, this is the second month in a row."," I thought there was a grace period."," There is no grace period in the rental agreement."," Oh, I guess I forgot."," Well, when can I expect the rent?"," You'll get it by Monday."," Don't forget the $50 late fee."," Is that in the rental agreement?"," The late fee is circled in red ink!"," Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement."," If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling."," Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row."," But I thought that I had a grace period."," I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period."," Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived."," Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent."," I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday."," Don't forget to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?"," How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!"," If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you."," Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please?"," Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling."," Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent."," Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late."," I thought you said there is a grace period."," Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place."," Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check."," I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday."," Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee."," I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement."," If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!"," I forget where I put my rental agreement."," One more late check, and you're looking at eviction."," Hello. This is Nicole."," This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling."," Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent."," Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month."," What happened to my grace period?"," Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month."," I guess I might be a little confused."," What day in the near future can I expect your check?"," My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday."," Remember to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?"," I seem to have lost my rental agreement."," Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling."," Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue."," What about my grace period?"," Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's."," I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future."," Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow."," Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee."," Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars."," Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee."," As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again."," I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted."," Hello, this is Betty."," Hi, Betty. Larry here.

Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please."," This apartment came with one, and I installed another one."," Are there fresh batteries in each of them?"," Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping."," Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by?"," If you're thirsty, you can grab a beer or soda out of my frig."," Thanks, but it'll only take me about two minutes to test them and leave."," Hi, this is Betty."," There was one when I moved in.

All I get is junk mail and bills."," Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys."," Sure, that'll be fine."," Okay. I'll see you Wednesday.

Do you have any questions for me?"," Just one: Is there a parking lot?"," Unfortunately, you have to park in the street."," Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway."," Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in."," I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay."," No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow."," Hello. You've reached Albert."," I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room? "," Yes, very much so."," Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?"," Fire away."," I just want to make sure that we are compatible."," That's a good idea. We need to get along."," Do you like to party?"," I don't party, and I don't like people who do."," Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?"," One of my mottoes is to clean as you go."," Do you sleep in or rise early?"," I go to bed early, and I get up early."," And last, are you a smoker?"," I can't stand cigarette smoke."," Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?"," Only one. Where can I park my car?"," I hate to tell you, but it's street parking."," I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it."," Great!

I don't have time to party."," Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?"," I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too."," What time do you usually hit the sack?"," Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day."," What about smoking?"," If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide."," Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?"," Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?"," I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street."," I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now."," Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here."," How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?"," Just ring the doorbell.

Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?"," Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat."," What kind of hours do you keep?"," The early bird gets the worm."," I hope you're not a smoker."," I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag."," Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?"," Just one question. What's the parking situation?"," I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it."," I can move in by tomorrow afternoon."," That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway."," Hello, Albert here. "," Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? "," Yes, I need a room badly."," Can I ask you a few questions?"," I'm an open book."," I want to make sure that we get along okay."," I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony."," Do you like to drink and party?"," I hate noise, and I hate loud people."," Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?"," A place for everything, and everything in its place."," Do you keep normal hours?"," I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news."," You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?"," Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world."," I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?"," Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?"," You're not going to like this. It's street parking only."," That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it."," I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow."," Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day."," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C."," Oh, hi, Hannah."," There is something wrong with my garbage disposal."," Exactly what's going on?"," When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence."," When did this happen?"," Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange."," Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?"," No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it."," Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal."," Well, no one ever told me that."," Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?"," I don't have a key."," Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman."," Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal."," Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP."," Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C."," Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from."," My garbage disposal refuses to work."," What happens when you turn on the switch?"," When I turn on the switch, nothing happens."," When did you first notice this?"," A week ago it started sounding different."," Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?"," I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it."," Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough."," Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?"," Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key."," What key?"," A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you."," Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it."," If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone."," Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem."," Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can."," Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah."," Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?"," My garbage disposal isn't working."," Can you be a little more specific?"," Nothing happens when I turn on the switch."," Do you remember how it started?"," about a week ago I noticed a new sound."," You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?"," I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently."," That's interesting. I never heard that before."," Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?"," I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it."," I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it."," I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over."," The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber."," If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me."," Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later."," Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C."," Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?"," My garbage disposal went south."," Does it turn at all?"," There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch."," Did it die suddenly?"," It started to make a weird sound last week."," You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?"," Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently."," Once a week might not be enough, huh?"," There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up."," Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it."," How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?"," Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys."," The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman."," It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not."," Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?"," Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling."," Hi, Hannah. What's up?"," I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket."," Is it dying, or is it dead?"," Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch."," Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?"," Last week I noticed that it sounded strange."," You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?"," I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it."," I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently."," You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?"," Try loosening it up by using the disposal key."," Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key."," Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over."," Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing."," Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned."," Yes, this is John Smith."," John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news."," Great, what is it?"," The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you."," That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy."," Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees."," Fees, what kind of fees?"," You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit."," Oh, those fees!"," No problem, what's your address?"," Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when can I move in?"," The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys."," Very good! Let me have your phone number."," Sure.

I don't remember anything about fees."," You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," But, of course.

Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," So, when can I start packing? When can I move in?"," Very good!

I don't know what to say."," Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees."," Fees, I don't remember anything about fees."," Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit."," Oh, yes, of course, those fees!"," All I need is your address, and the check will be in the mail pronto."," My address is 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107."," Okay, got it. Now when will he let me move in?"," Okay, give me your phone number, please."," You can always reach me, or leave a message, at 626-555-3000."," Hello, Nicole here."," Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling."," Oh, it's about the rent."," Yes, this is the second month in a row."," I thought there was a grace period."," There is no grace period in the rental agreement."," Oh, I guess I forgot."," Well, when can I expect the rent?"," You'll get it by Monday."," Don't forget the $50 late fee."," Is that in the rental agreement?"," The late fee is circled in red ink!"," Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement."," If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling."," Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row."," But I thought that I had a grace period."," I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period."," Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived."," Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent."," I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday."," Don't forget to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?"," How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!"," If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you."," Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please?"," Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling."," Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent."," Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late."," I thought you said there is a grace period."," Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place."," Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check."," I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday."," Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee."," I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement."," If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!"," I forget where I put my rental agreement."," One more late check, and you're looking at eviction."," Hello. This is Nicole."," This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling."," Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent."," Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month."," What happened to my grace period?"," Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month."," I guess I might be a little confused."," What day in the near future can I expect your check?"," My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday."," Remember to include the $50 late fee."," Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?"," I seem to have lost my rental agreement."," Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted."," Hi, this is Nicole."," Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling."," Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?"," Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue."," What about my grace period?"," Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's."," I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future."," Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow."," Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee."," Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars."," Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee."," As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again."," I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted."," Hello, this is Betty."," Hi, Betty. Larry here.

I'm finished."," I think there's more you need to do."," What do you mean by that?"," My hair looks awful."," What don't you like about it?"," I just don't like my hair."," I'm sorry that you don't like it."," I won't be paying you for this."," I'm sure we can work something out."," Have you been coming to this Laundromat long?"," I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago."," Why is that?"," It doesn't cost me as much to wash here."," I've just started doing my clothes here."," Why are you washing your clothes here now?"," My washing machine broke down."," You should just pay someone to fix it."," It's too expensive to get it fixed."," So you're just going to wash here?"," Yes, I think that's what I'm going to have to do."," It costs less to wash here."," How long have you been washing clothes here?"," I started washing here about three years ago."," How come?"," I can wash my clothes for less money here."," This is my first time washing clothes here."," What reason are you washing here today?"," I can't wash at home because my machine is broken."," Go and get it repaired."," That'll cost too much."," Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while?"," I have no choice."," Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money."," Do you wash clothes here often?"," I have been coming here for the past few years."," Why do you wash here?"," It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here."," I've only washed my clothes here a couple times."," Why don't you wash clothes at home?"," I would, if my washing machine wasn't broken."," Why don't you just get it fixed?"," I can't afford it."," So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?"," That's my only option right now."," Don't worry. Besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way."," I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer."," What's the problem?"," I need help turning them on."," You need change."," The machines take change?"," Yes. It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer."," How do I do it?"," You put the coins into the slot, push it in, and it will turn on."," That's it?"," There's nothing else to it."," Thank you very much."," You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else."," I need help using the washer and dryer."," Tell me what the problem is."," I can't figure out how to turn them on."," Do you have some quarters?"," I didn't know I needed change."," The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar."," Where do I put the change?"," Is that everything that I have to do?"," That's all there is."," I appreciate you helping me with this."," If you need anything else, just let me know."," Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer?"," What do you need help with?"," Do you know how to turn them on?"," Do you have any change?"," I need change for the machines?"," You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer."," So what do I need to do?"," The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot."," That's really all I have to do?"," That's everything."," Thanks for all your help."," I'm here if you need any more help."," I'm returning your phone call."," I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast."," No problem, but what were you calling about?"," I needed to talk to you about your son."," Is he messing up in school?"," He was acting up in class one day last week."," What was he doing?"," He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class."," I don't know what's gotten into him."," If you could, would you please talk to him?"," I will get right on that, and I am very sorry."," I really appreciate your help."," Did you call me?"," Thank you for returning my call."," What was your call about?"," I wanted to have a talk with you about your son."," What did he do?"," He was messing around last week in class."," Exactly what did he do?"," Even though I asked him not to, he kept speaking out in class."," I don't know what his problem is."," I need you to talk to him, if you don't mind."," That won't happen again, I'm sorry."," Thank you. Hopefully I won't have to call about him again."," I believe that you called me?"," Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me quickly."," Why did you call me?"," I was calling about your son."," Did he do something wrong?"," Your son was acting up in class."," What do you mean?"," He was talking and causing a disturbance during class."," That's really not like him."," If you could just talk to him, I would greatly appreciate it."," I apologize, and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again."," Don't worry about it, but thank you very much."," It's nice to meet you."," I'm glad we're meeting today. Thank you."," You're welcome."," I would like to talk to you about your daughter."," Is there a problem?"," No, your daughter is great."," That's great news."," Your daughter is a wonderful student."," She isn't messing up in class?"," Of course not. Your daughter is smart and very well behaved."," I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well."," It is my pleasure to have her in my class."," We finally get a chance to meet."," Thank you for meeting me here."," It's no problem."," I need to speak with you about your daughter."," Is there something wrong?"," I enjoy having your daughter in my class."," I'm glad to hear it."," She is a great addition to my class."," You don't have anything bad to say about her?"," She is always behaving herself, and she's so smart."," I am so happy that she's doing okay."," I'm more than happy having her in my class."," How are you?"," It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming."," It's my pleasure."," I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter."," Is she acting up in class?"," Not at all. She's a joy to have in my class."," Is she really?"," She is absolutely wonderful."," So she isn't causing you any problems?"," No. She is actually very intelligent and well behaved."," I'm glad to know that you like her."," You have nothing to worry about with her."," Can you go to the store for me?"," Sure, I can go to the store for you. What do you need?"," Just a couple things, here's a list."," Is there anything else that you want me to pick up?"," No, I think that's all that I need."," Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you?"," If you can, could you pick up my prescription for me?"," Sure, no problem. Is your prescription ready?"," I think so. It should be."," Okay, I'll pick it up for you."," Thank you so much."," You're welcome."," Can you pick up some things from the store for me?"," Of course, what do you need? "," I need a few things, I'll give you the list."," Is there something else you need that you can think of?"," Everything I need is on the list."," Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out?"," Since you asked, would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy?"," Is it ready to be picked up?"," I believe so."," No problem. I'll do that for you."," I really appreciate you doing this for me."," It's no problem at all."," I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me."," No problem. What do you want me to get?"," Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get."," Did you forget to put anything on the list?"," I don't think I forgot anything."," Would you like me to go anywhere else for you?"," Has your prescription been filled yet?"," Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready."," Sure, I'll go get it for you."," Thank you."," Anything for you."," How much is the fare for this bus?"," It costs $1.25 to ride the bus."," So, how long have you been driving buses?"," I've been driving this bus for only a few months."," Do you enjoy being a bus driver?"," Not really."," I would never dream of driving a bus."," I didn't either, but a paycheck's a paycheck."," It was nice talking to you."," Nice talking to you too."," Have a good day."," That'll be hard to do while driving the bus."," How much for the bus ride?"," It's $1.25 for this bus."," How long have you been a bus driver?"," I started driving the bus a few months ago."," Is it fun driving the bus?"," Not at all."," I don't think I ever wanted to be a bus driver."," I never did either, but it pays the bills."," I enjoyed talking to you. "," I liked talking to you too."," What does it cost to ride this bus?"," The fare is $1.25."," Have you been driving buses a long time?"," I haven't been driving for long�only for a few months."," Do you like to drive the bus?"," Not in the least bit."," I would have never dreamed of ever becoming a bus driver."," It was really fun chatting with you."," It was really nice talking to you too."," Have a good one."," I'll have a good day once this day is over."," Do you realize what time it is?"," I'm sorry, I lost track of time."," Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse?"," Not at all--that is what really happened."," How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late?"," Yes, I know. I must've forgot."," That's beside the point, you still should have called."," You're right. I'm sorry."," Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone."," You're really going to kick me out?"," Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules."," Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore."," Do you have any idea what time it is?"," My bad. I didn't realize that it was so late."," Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness?"," Of course not. I really did lose track of time."," Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?"," Yeah, you did. I just forgot to call."," It doesn't matter, you should have called and let me know."," That's true. My bad for not calling."," If you do this again, don't even bother coming home."," You're going to kick me out over this?"," Exactly, maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules."," Do you know how late it is?"," My fault. I didn't realize what time it was."," I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook."," Not really. I'm telling the truth."," Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?"," This is true, but it must've slipped my mind."," Regardless, all you had to do was give a call."," I know. I should've called."," Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside."," You want to throw me out over this?"," That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules."," That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter."," Did you clean your room today?"," No, not yet."," When were you planning on doing that?"," I'm going to clean it up later."," Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier?"," I'm going to clean it."," I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything."," I know.

I am still going to clean it up."," Make sure you vacuum and dust your room."," I won't forget."," I don't want you to leave until you clean up."," My plans aren't until later, so I'll clean it before I go."," Have you started cleaning up your room yet?"," I haven't gotten started on my room yet."," When exactly do you plan on cleaning it?"," I have every intention of cleaning my room later."," I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier."," I already told you that I'm going to do it."," Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything."," I'll remember to do that."," Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room."," I'll clean my room before I leave."," Man, I'm so hungry!

I haven't eaten anything all day."," Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito."," I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!"," If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?"," I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then."," Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat."," That's pretty messed up."," Why don't you just go home and eat?"," I don't want to go all the way home just to eat."," Well, I guess you're out of luck."," I really want a burrito! Can you get me one?"," I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me."," Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?"," I only have a few dollars."," I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry."," I want to eat too. Ask someone else to feed you."," Since I get my check this Friday, I can give you your money back then."," So then, this Friday you'll be able to eat."," You're mean to say that."," You should just go home and make yourself a sandwich or something."," My house is too far, and I'm really hungry."," It sounds as if you're going to continue starving."," I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito."," I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you."," I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today."," I really don't have enough money."," My stomach feels so empty."," Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too."," I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then."," Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat."," That's not nice. "," You can always go home and make something to eat."," I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here."," Sorry.

I'll do it for you."," Thanks a lot."," You're welcome."," It's time for bed."," I'm not ready to go to sleep. I'm not tired."," It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow."," I'm not going to be able to fall asleep."," Why don't you try counting sheep?"," I've tried that before. It really doesn't work."," That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed."," Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?"," If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night."," I promise I'll go to sleep soon."," No, you're going to sleep now, so good night."," See you in the morning."," Shouldn't you already be in bed?"," I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired."," You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning."," It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now."," Just close your eyes, and try not to think."," That really does not work for me."," It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep."," How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?"," Then you're not going to go to sleep."," Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while."," I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams."," Fine. Sleep well yourself."," Isn't it past your bedtime already?"," I am not sleepy. "," It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow."," There is no way that I can fall asleep right now."," Try listening to some soft music."," It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired."," I really don't care, just go to sleep."," What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?"," You'll be up all night if I let you do that."," I'm going to get to sleep eventually."," You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep."," Good night."," Wake up, it's time for school."," I'm so tired.

Can you get me one?"," I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me."," Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?"," I only have a few dollars."," I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry."," I want to eat too.

I must've forgot."," That's beside the point, you still should have called."," You're right. I'm sorry."," Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone."," You're really going to kick me out?"," Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules."," Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore."," Do you have any idea what time it is?"," My bad.

I'm telling the truth."," Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?"," This is true, but it must've slipped my mind."," Regardless, all you had to do was give a call."," I know. I should've called."," Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside."," You want to throw me out over this?"," That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules."," That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter."," Did you clean your room today?"," No, not yet."," When were you planning on doing that?"," I'm going to clean it up later."," Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier?"," I'm going to clean it."," I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything."," I know.

Can you get me one?"," I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me."," Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?"," I only have a few dollars."," I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry."," I want to eat too.

It seems like they've been overcooked."," I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food."," George, is your chicken OK?"," It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?"," My fish is very dry."," I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it. "," That's exactly what I was thinking had happened."," Are your vegetables OK?"," The vegetables are kind of mushy."," So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long."," Does your chicken taste all right?"," The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?"," My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry."," It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us."," Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight."," Are your vegetables a little mushy?"," The vegetables seem to not be very fresh."," Mine aren't so good, either."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks.

The total for our meal is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?"," Yes, 20 percent would be perfect."," Yes, that was one fantastic meal!"," I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week."," Would you like to order anything else?"," No, I'm good. All we need now is our check."," The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak."," Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00."," How much money should we leave for a tip?"," She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip."," Yes, what a wonderful meal!"," It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?"," Where is our waitress anyway?"," Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?"," Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together."," So the bill is $36.00."," How much do you think we should leave for a tip?"," My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip."," Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service."," I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip."," Would you like some more coffee?"," No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill."," Good luck finding the waitress!"," The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?"," I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way."," Good. I'll just stay here until you get back."," So the total is $36.00 for our dinner."," How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?"," I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service."," I think that we should leave 10%."," $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip."," Would you like to order anything else?"," No, I'm good. All we need now is our check."," Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?"," She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check."," Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together."," Our total for dinner is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to tip?"," I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received."," I believe that 10% is just about right."," I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave."," So, how did you like the restaurant?"," I thought that it was very good. "," I felt the food was excellent."," What did you like the best?"," I liked the fish the best."," I liked the fish also, but I really enjoyed the dessert the most."," Yes, the macadamia cakes were wonderful."," Wasn't the service top-notch?"," Yes, the waiter was very attentive."," I hope to be able to come back to this restaurant soon."," Did you like the restaurant?"," It was pretty good."," The food was wonderful."," What was your favorite dish?"," The fish was my favorite."," Yes, the fish was great, but the dessert was awesome."," I agree that the macadamia cake was awesome."," Didn't you think that the service was the best?"," Yes, our waiter really went out of the way for us."," I would like to return to this restaurant soon."," How do you feel about this restaurant?"," I really liked it!"," I really enjoyed the food."," What did you enjoy the most?"," I enjoyed the fish the most."," The fish was pretty special, but I loved the dessert."," The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world!"," I really felt that the service was exceptionally good."," Yes, the service really added to the experience."," I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant."," So how did you like the restaurant?"," Actually, it could have been better."," What didn't you like about it?"," It is a new restaurant.

How is your fish?"," My fish is pretty dry too."," Yes, it seems that way to me also."," How are your vegetables?"," My vegetables are very soggy."," Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked."," I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food."," George, is your chicken OK?"," It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?"," My fish is very dry."," I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it. "," That's exactly what I was thinking had happened."," Are your vegetables OK?"," The vegetables are kind of mushy."," So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long."," Does your chicken taste all right?"," The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?"," My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry."," It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us."," Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight."," Are your vegetables a little mushy?"," The vegetables seem to not be very fresh."," Mine aren't so good, either."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?"," Here comes our waitress with our check."," The service here has been really great, don't you think?"," Yes, the service was quite good."," So, let's look at the check.

I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill."," The waitress is bringing the bill right now."," This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?"," Yes, this waitress did a great job."," OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?"," Yes, 20 percent would be perfect."," Yes, that was one fantastic meal!"," I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week."," Would you like to order anything else?"," No, I'm good. All we need now is our check."," The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak."," Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00."," How much money should we leave for a tip?"," She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip."," Yes, what a wonderful meal!"," It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?"," Where is our waitress anyway?"," Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?"," Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together."," So the bill is $36.00."," How much do you think we should leave for a tip?"," My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip."," Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service."," I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip."," Would you like some more coffee?"," No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill."," Good luck finding the waitress!"," The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?"," I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way."," Good. I'll just stay here until you get back."," So the total is $36.00 for our dinner."," How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?"," I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service."," I think that we should leave 10%."," $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip."," Would you like to order anything else?"," No, I'm good. All we need now is our check."," Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?"," She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check."," Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together."," Our total for dinner is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to tip?"," I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received."," I believe that 10% is just about right."," I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave."," So, how did you like the restaurant?"," I thought that it was very good. "," I felt the food was excellent."," What did you like the best?"," I liked the fish the best."," I liked the fish also, but I really enjoyed the dessert the most."," Yes, the macadamia cakes were wonderful."," Wasn't the service top-notch?"," Yes, the waiter was very attentive."," I hope to be able to come back to this restaurant soon."," Did you like the restaurant?"," It was pretty good."," The food was wonderful."," What was your favorite dish?"," The fish was my favorite."," Yes, the fish was great, but the dessert was awesome."," I agree that the macadamia cake was awesome."," Didn't you think that the service was the best?"," Yes, our waiter really went out of the way for us."," I would like to return to this restaurant soon."," How do you feel about this restaurant?"," I really liked it!"," I really enjoyed the food."," What did you enjoy the most?"," I enjoyed the fish the most."," The fish was pretty special, but I loved the dessert."," The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world!"," I really felt that the service was exceptionally good."," Yes, the service really added to the experience."," I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant."," So how did you like the restaurant?"," Actually, it could have been better."," What didn't you like about it?"," It is a new restaurant.

Is your fish OK?"," My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry."," It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us."," Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight."," Are your vegetables a little mushy?"," The vegetables seem to not be very fresh."," Mine aren't so good, either."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?"," Here comes our waitress with our check."," The service here has been really great, don't you think?"," Yes, the service was quite good."," So, let's look at the check.

I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill."," The waitress is bringing the bill right now."," This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?"," Yes, this waitress did a great job."," OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?"," Yes, 20 percent would be perfect."," Yes, that was one fantastic meal!"," I agree.

We'll have to return here for lunch sometime."," Do you want some dessert?"," No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?"," Where is our waitress anyway?"," Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?"," Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together."," So the bill is $36.00."," How much do you think we should leave for a tip?"," My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip."," Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service."," I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip."," Would you like some more coffee?"," No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill."," Good luck finding the waitress!"," The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?"," I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way."," Good. I'll just stay here until you get back."," So the total is $36.00 for our dinner."," How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?"," I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service."," I think that we should leave 10%."," $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip."," Would you like to order anything else?"," No, I'm good. All we need now is our check."," Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?"," She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check."," Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together."," Our total for dinner is $36.00."," What do you think would be the right amount to tip?"," I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received."," I believe that 10% is just about right."," I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave."," So, how did you like the restaurant?"," I thought that it was very good.

Thank you!"," I really love this car!"," Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it."," How much are you willing to take for the car?"," As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars."," Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?"," You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit."," Would you sell it to me for four thousand?"," I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred."," I'll take it then!"," Perfect!

It's good to find a person who really needs this car."," What is the price for this car?"," The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars."," I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit."," I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price."," I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred."," That would work well for me."," It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you."," How much does this car cost?"," I really was just wondering what the price is."," I was thinking a little lower than that."," I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars."," OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer."," If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?"," Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now."," Can't you just tell me what it costs?"," Thirteen thousand would be more like it."," Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident."," How much money for this car?"," I just want to know the price."," I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later."," Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?"," I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car."," I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price."," Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer."," I really love the look of this car."," Would you like to test drive this car?"," Yes, I would love to take it for a drive."," Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?"," That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!"," This car handles great, and I love it!"," I am glad that you like this car."," The styling of this car really appeals to me."," Would you like to take this car for a spin?"," That would be a great idea."," Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready."," I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed."," As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine."," Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!"," Yes, this is a very popular car."," Wow, what a cool car!"," How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?"," I would enjoy seeing how it handles."," I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road."," I want to take the car up to freeway speed."," This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway."," You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you."," Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?"," Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website."," Basically, what will I need to do?"," Will I have to pay any fees?"," All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer."," How much will it cost to transfer the title?"," The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you."," Do I need a Smog Certificate?"," No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975."," Where do I take my forms?"," You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process."," I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car."," If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website."," What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?"," The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign. They also both need to fill out the Change of Ownership form."," Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?"," The buyer must pay all of the fees."," Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?"," The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork."," What about a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine."," Where can I turn in my forms?"," Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?"," You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful."," Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?"," When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred."," Are there any fees involved?"," As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees."," How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?"," The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you."," Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one."," Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?"," Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV."," Where is the best place to buy a used car?"," Where else could I look for a car?"," The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot."," Where is CarMax?"," How about the listings on the college bulletin board?"," Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?"," What are my other options for looking for a used car?"," The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out."," How can I find out where CarMax is?"," Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?"," Where did you buy your last used car?"," Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?"," Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?"," I don't know where CarMax is."," Could you tell me what window I should go to?"," Do you have an appointment?"," Yes, I have an appointment."," The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?"," I need to transfer ownership of a used car."," Thanks for helping me."," You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?"," Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me!"," It depends on what you are doing. Did you make an appointment?"," I made an appointment last month."," All of the windows are for specific services. What do you need to do today?"," I just bought a used car and need to transfer the ownership."," Thank you, that helps me know what to do."," My pleasure. The only other thing I need is your current Driver's License."," Here is my license, it is a very old picture of me!"," Could you help direct me to the proper window?"," I made my appointment over the Internet."," I need help transferring the ownership of a new car from my friend to myself."," The signed forms go in the box, and I will call your name in a few minutes."," Thank you for making it

I can't wait to see your new car!"," That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it."," From what I see, it's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?"," A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it."," Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that."," Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?"," Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union."," I appreciate the offer of help!"," I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal."," My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning."," Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him."," Have you thought about how to pay for your car?"," I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car."," That would make it a lot easier for me."," Let's go take care of that right now. I really want to see your new car!"," Thank you for letting me test drive the car."," So do you think that you would like to purchase this car?"," You know, I am not interested in purchasing the car right now."," What's the problem? We can at least sit down and maybe work out a deal."," Actually, I have several other cars to look at before I make my decision."," What didn't you like about the car? Maybe I can fix something for you."," It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time."," I have some other cars you might want to look at."," Again, I appreciate your time but I will not be purchasing this car."," Give me a call if you change your mind. Have a good day."," I appreciate you letting me take the car out for a spin."," Why don't you come over here and we can work out the details of the purchase?"," I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time."," It's a great deal. Let's talk price. Maybe you'll change your mind."," This is only the first car that I've looked at."," Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?"," It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money."," I really think that you should reconsider."," Thank you again for your time."," Thank you for stopping by. Good luck in your search for a car."," I enjoyed taking the car out for a test drive."," Isn't that a great car? Let's work out the details of purchase."," I will not be purchasing the car today."," I need to compare this car to others to make an informed choice."," I just really need to make sure that I get the best car for my money."," OK, then. Have a good day."," Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look."," I just wasn't sure what to look for."," Should we take the car for a drive?"," As I am driving what should I be checking?"," Thanks for your help."," You are welcome. Enjoy driving your car!"," I am happy to help. Just pull up and we'll give it a good look."," I don't know much about cars."," Will you take a drive with me to check handling?"," On a test drive, what should I look for?"," We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling."," I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for."," My pleasure. This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you."," I would like for you to take a test drive with me."," As we drive, what am I checking for?"," This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!"," I can help you. Do you have a down payment?"," Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment."," I don't know where exactly to get a loan."," What is the best choice for financing?"," What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?"," Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?"," Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment."," I am not sure who will loan money to me."," Who offers the best interest rate?"," Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?"," I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment?"," I will be getting money from selling my old car."," Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?"," What is the best place to get financing?"," Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?"," If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?"," What if I just show up there?"," If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you."," Is the DMV open on Saturdays?"," Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays."," I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club!"," Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!"," How can I make an appointment at the DMV?"," How do I make an appointment if I have to actually go in?"," Can I just walk in and get help?"," Can I take care of this on a Saturday?"," Unfortunately, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays."," It probably would be easier for me to join the Automobile Club."," What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?"," What about going to the DMV on Saturday?"," For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore."," I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion."," This car is exactly what I want!"," I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car."," So, how much do you want for the car?"," Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars."," Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car."," I might be able to come down a little on the price."," How about selling the car for four thousand?"," That sounds fair to me."," It's a deal then. Thank you!"," I really love this car!"," Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it."," How much are you willing to take for the car?"," As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars."," Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?"," You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit."," Would you sell it to me for four thousand?"," I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred."," I'll take it then!"," Perfect! That works for both of us."," I am definitely interested in buying this car."," Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car."," What is the price for this car?"," The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars."," I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit."," I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price."," I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred."," That would work well for me."," It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you."," How much does this car cost?"," I really was just wondering what the price is."," I was thinking a little lower than that."," I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars."," OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer."," If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?"," Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now."," Can't you just tell me what it costs?"," Thirteen thousand would be more like it."," Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident."," How much money for this car?"," I just want to know the price."," I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later."," Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?"," I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car."," I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price."," Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer."," I really love the look of this car."," Would you like to test drive this car?"," Yes, I would love to take it for a drive."," Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?"," That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!"," This car handles great, and I love it!"," I am glad that you like this car."," The styling of this car really appeals to me."," Would you like to take this car for a spin?"," That would be a great idea."," Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready."," I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed."," As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine."," Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!"," Yes, this is a very popular car."," Wow, what a cool car!"," How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?"," I would enjoy seeing how it handles."," I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road."," I want to take the car up to freeway speed."," This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway."," You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you."," Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?"," Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website."," Basically, what will I need to do?"," Will I have to pay any fees?"," All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer."," How much will it cost to transfer the title?"," The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you."," Do I need a Smog Certificate?"," No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975."," Where do I take my forms?"," You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process."," I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car."," If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website."," What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?"," The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign. They also both need to fill out the Change of Ownership form."," Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?"," The buyer must pay all of the fees."," Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?"," The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork."," What about a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine."," Where can I turn in my forms?"," Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?"," You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful."," Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?"," When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred."," Are there any fees involved?"," As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees."," How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?"," The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you."," Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one."," Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?"," Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV."," Where is the best place to buy a used car?"," Where else could I look for a car?"," The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot."," Where is CarMax?"," How about the listings on the college bulletin board?"," Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?"," What are my other options for looking for a used car?"," The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out."," How can I find out where CarMax is?"," Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?"," Where did you buy your last used car?"," Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?"," Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?"," I don't know where CarMax is."," Could you tell me what window I should go to?"," Do you have an appointment?"," Yes, I have an appointment."," The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?"," I need to transfer ownership of a used car."," Thanks for helping me."," You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?"," Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me!"," It depends on what you are doing.

I've had good experiences with this car."," So, how much do you want for the car?"," Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars."," Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car."," I might be able to come down a little on the price."," How about selling the car for four thousand?"," That sounds fair to me."," It's a deal then. Thank you!"," I really love this car!"," Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it."," How much are you willing to take for the car?"," As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars."," Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?"," You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit."," Would you sell it to me for four thousand?"," I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred."," I'll take it then!"," Perfect! That works for both of us."," I am definitely interested in buying this car."," Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car."," What is the price for this car?"," The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars."," I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit."," I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price."," I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred."," That would work well for me."," It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you."," How much does this car cost?"," I really was just wondering what the price is."," I was thinking a little lower than that."," I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars."," OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer."," If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?"," Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now."," Can't you just tell me what it costs?"," Thirteen thousand would be more like it."," Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident."," How much money for this car?"," I just want to know the price."," I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later."," Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?"," I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car."," I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price."," Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer."," I really love the look of this car."," Would you like to test drive this car?"," Yes, I would love to take it for a drive."," Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?"," That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!"," This car handles great, and I love it!"," I am glad that you like this car."," The styling of this car really appeals to me."," Would you like to take this car for a spin?"," That would be a great idea."," Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready."," I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed."," As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine."," Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!"," Yes, this is a very popular car."," Wow, what a cool car!"," How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?"," I would enjoy seeing how it handles."," I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance."," Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road."," I want to take the car up to freeway speed."," This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway."," You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you."," Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?"," Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website."," Basically, what will I need to do?"," Will I have to pay any fees?"," All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer."," How much will it cost to transfer the title?"," The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you."," Do I need a Smog Certificate?"," No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975."," Where do I take my forms?"," You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process."," I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car."," If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website."," What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?"," The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign. They also both need to fill out the Change of Ownership form."," Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?"," The buyer must pay all of the fees."," Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?"," The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork."," What about a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine."," Where can I turn in my forms?"," Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?"," You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can be very helpful."," Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?"," When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred."," Are there any fees involved?"," As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees."," How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?"," The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you."," Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?"," No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one."," Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?"," Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV."," Where is the best place to buy a used car?"," Where else could I look for a car?"," The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot."," Where is CarMax?"," How about the listings on the college bulletin board?"," Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?"," What are my other options for looking for a used car?"," The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out."," How can I find out where CarMax is?"," Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?"," Where did you buy your last used car?"," Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?"," Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?"," I don't know where CarMax is."," Could you tell me what window I should go to?"," Do you have an appointment?"," Yes, I have an appointment."," The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?"," I need to transfer ownership of a used car."," Thanks for helping me."," You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?"," Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me!"," It depends on what you are doing.

What do you need to do today?"," I just bought a used car and need to transfer the ownership."," Thank you, that helps me know what to do."," My pleasure.

Have you?"," I got a ticket yesterday."," Really? What did you get one for?"," I parked in the red zone."," Why did you do that?"," I needed to get something real quickly."," Where did you park at?"," At my apartment building."," Don't you have your own parking spot?"," I needed to be fast."," That was very lazy of you."," Have you gotten a parking ticket before?"," No, I haven't. What about you?"," I got a ticket a couple of days ago."," What did you do?"," I got it for parking in the red zone."," Why would you park in the red zone?"," I had to run in and get something quickly."," Where were you at?"," I got the ticket in front of my apartment."," I thought that you had your own parking spot?"," I had to make it quick."," Hope it was worth it."," Did you ever get a parking ticket?"," No, have you?"," Yes, I just got one the other day."," How'd you get a ticket?"," The ticket was for parking in the red zone."," I don't understand why you would do that."," There was nowhere to park, and I needed to run in and get something."," Where'd you get the ticket at?"," I parked in front of my apartment building."," What about your parking spot?"," But I really needed to be quick."," I bet that you wish you hadn't done that."," Have you ever gotten a parking ticket?"," I've gotten a few."," How many is a few?"," I've gotten about six."," Have you paid all your tickets off?"," Yes, I've paid all of them off."," How much is the fine?"," It's like $130 each ticket."," That's not cheap at all."," I got a parking ticket the other day."," Pay it off, and they'll clear your record."," I'm going to do that as soon as possible."," Did you ever get a parking ticket?"," Only a few."," What's a few?"," I've gotten six, I think."," Did you pay your fines?"," Of course I have."," How much are the parking tickets?"," I think they're $130."," That's expensive."," I just got a parking ticket."," You should probably pay the fine soon."," I'm going to pay it today."," How many parking tickets have you gotten before?"," I've gotten a few parking tickets before."," How many?"," Only about five or six."," Have you paid off your parking tickets?"," Yes, I paid my fines."," How much do you have to pay for the ticket?"," If I remember correctly, it's about $130."," That's a lot of money."," I got one the other day."," You better make sure you pay it off."," I may just go to the DMV today, so I can pay the fine."," Is there a problem, officer?"," Did you not notice that stop sign that you ran through?"," I'm sorry, I didn't even notice it."," You didn't see it?"," I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it."," That's true. Those bushes are a problem."," I swear that I didn't mean to run it."," I can understand why you didn't stop for it."," Are you going to give me a ticket today, sir?"," Under the circumstances, I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning."," Thanks a lot."," No problem. Next time, just pay closer attention."," What's the problem?"," There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for."," I really didn't see it."," How'd you miss it?"," I only saw bushes at the intersection."," Those bushes are covering the stop sign."," I really didn't mean to run it."," I see why you didn't stop."," Are you still going to write me a ticket?"," No, I'm just going to let you go."," Thanks for being so understanding."," That's all right. Make sure to look closely next time."," What's up, officer?"," Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign?"," There was a stop sign?"," How could you not notice it?"," You're right.

I need to have something done about those bushes."," Is there a problem, officer?"," I stopped you for driving through a red light."," Did I really?"," You didn't know?"," I had no idea that I ran it."," Don't you know that yellow means slow down?"," Yes, sir."," Why'd you speed up instead?"," I really have no excuse, sir."," I'll have to write you a ticket."," I understand, and I am very sorry."," Here's your ticket."," What's wrong, officer?"," You do realize that you ran a red light, don't you?"," I did?"," You didn't see the red light?"," I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know."," Didn't you learn that red means stop?"," I know that."," Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light."," I'm not sure."," I'm giving you a ticket for this."," I'm sorry for the misunderstanding."," Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light."," Why'd you pull me over?"," Are you aware that you drove through a red light?"," I ran a red light?"," Yes, you did."," I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did that."," Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?"," I did learn that."," So, then why did you speed up?"," I don't know what to tell you."," I'm going to have to write you a ticket."," I understand."," Here you go. Don't do that again."," You're here today to argue your ticket?"," I am."," Plead your case."," The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding."," Were you speeding when you got pulled over?"," I was not speeding."," How fast were you going?"," In a 40 mph zone, I was only going about 35."," Seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here, I'll let you go."," Do I still need to pay the fine?"," No, you don't."," I appreciate your understanding."," You want to argue your ticket today?"," Yes. That is why I'm here."," Tell me your argument."," I was pulled over for allegedly speeding."," Are you sure you weren't speeding?"," To be honest, I really wasn't."," What speed were you going?"," I was under the speed limit. I was going 35, when the speed limit was 40."," I'm just going to let you go, since the arresting officer isn't here."," What about my ticket? Do I still need to pay?"," Don't worry about it."," I'm so glad for your help."," Are you here about your ticket?"," Yes, I am, Your Honor."," What is your argument?"," Your Honor, the police officer pulled me over for speeding."," You must've been speeding."," No, Your Honor, I was not."," Tell me how many miles per hour you were going."," I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone."," That's fine, so I'll let you go with a warning."," So, I don't have to pay the ticket?"," You won't have to pay the fine."," Thank you very much, Your Honor."," What are you here for today?"," I need to fight this ticket that I got."," Is the arresting officer here?"," Yes, he is, Your Honor."," Plead your case."," Why would the officer lie?"," I'm not sure, but the signal had a camera on it."," Did the camera take a picture of your license plate?"," No, my picture wasn't taken."," There was no picture taken, so I'll let you go."," Thank you very much, Your Honor."," Why are you in court today?"," I got a ticket, and I would like to fight it."," Is the officer that pulled you over here today?"," He's here."," Tell me what happened."," The officer says that I ran a red light, but I didn't."," The officer wouldn't lie about that."," He must've, because the signal had a camera on top of it."," There was no picture taken of your license plate?"," I don't believe it took my picture."," I'm just going to let you go."," I appreciate that."," What are you doing here today?"," I would like to fight my ticket."," Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?"," Yes, the officer is here today."," What's your case?"," I was pulled over for running a red light, but I never did."," Do you believe that the officer lied?"," There was a camera on the signal. So, he was obviously lying."," Your license plate was caught on camera?"," A picture of my license plate was never taken."," Thank you. I'm glad that you believe me."," I need to pay the fine on my ticket."," Do you have the ticket with you?"," Yes, I have my ticket with me."," Let me see your ID."," I forgot to bring that with me."," You need it to pay your fine."," Why can't I just give you the money for the fine?"," Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are."," I think I understand."," All right, come back and bring your ID."," So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared?"," Once you pay it, your record will be cleared."," Could I pay for my parking ticket?"," I need to see your ticket. Do you have it?"," Here's my ticket right here."," I'm going to need to see your ID."," I don't have it."," You can't pay your fine without your ID."," I don't understand why I can't just pay you."," We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it."," I get it now."," Just come back when you have your ID with you."," Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine?"," Only if you pay your fine."," I have a parking ticket to pay for."," Did you bring your ticket?"," Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today."," Did you bring your ID?"," I didn't bring my ID."," You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket."," What do you need my ID for?"," We have to know that this ticket is really yours."," All right, I see what you mean."," Next time you come back, bring your ID."," Will everything be cleared from my record?"," Yes, everything will be cleared."," Pasadena Traffic School.

Should this party be formal or casual?"," I think it should be casual."," I would prefer Chinese food for this party."," Perfect choice. For music, should we have a live band or a DJ?"," I think we should hire a live band."," I need help with the office party."," I have no idea what the entertainment should be."," Let's make it a formal affair."," American food would be the best choice."," We should bring in a really good DJ."," I would like to help you with both."," A dressy party would be fun!"," We should probably have both."," Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?"," Maybe we could do both!"," Is there anything I can help?"," I can do either one."," Good. That would be very helpful.

How many years have you been with the company?"," I just started working here."," I'd like to, but I am very busy."," What can I do to help you?"," I could do some typing for you."," That would be a good place to start."," I like your positive attitude. How many years have you been employed here?"," I have worked here long time."," I'm not sure. Let me think about it."," Can you help me with my timesheet?"," Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept?"," No, I don't know where to find one."," Yes, I can do that."," No, I don't know what that is."," Yes, I understand how to do this."," That was easy!"," Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on."," How do we do timesheets here?"," Yes, I already have one."," I am kind of confused."," I'm not quite sure."," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box."," Thanks for your help."," Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later."," I need help with my timesheet."," OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?"," Yes, I have seen them."," Yes, I understand what to do."," What? Huh?"," Huh? What?"," Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in."," I thought you said this was easy."," You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this."," I need help figuring out how to use this phone."," Yes, I hear the tone."," OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad. Do you hear the tone change?"," Yes, it changed."," I am trying to call home."," Yes, I have a list of extensions."," Well, if you ever need help with an extension, you can dial O."," Can you show me how to use this phone?"," No, I don't hear anything."," I'm not sure."," I am trying to call a client."," No, I don't know anyone's extension."," I want to make a phone call. Can you show me how?"," Yes, now what do I do?"," Well, after you dial 9 on the keypad, you should hear the tone change."," No, nothing changed."," I am trying to call my boss."," I know a few extensions but I don't know all of them."," You can always look an extension up on the company website."," I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting."," I would like to meet on Monday."," Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?"," I want to come in the morning."," Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting."," I think that we should have just the sub-committee."," No, I need directions, please."," Could I meet with you to discuss the project?"," Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?"," Tuesday would be good for me."," OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?"," I think the afternoon would be best."," Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting."," I feel that the whole committee needs to be there."," Yes, I know how to get there on my own."," When could we meet to discuss the project?"," I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you."," I prefer Monday."," Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?"," Either one is OK."," I will be prepared to do my presentation."," Everyone needs to be there."," That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?"," Certainly, what day would be best for you?"," I think that Monday or Tuesday would be good for me."," I can give you Monday; I have ten or eleven in the morning."," I think ten o'clock is best."," Fine, I'll put you down for that."," That would be great!"," Happy I could help you; see you then!"," Wednesday or Thursday would be perfect."," Thursday is available; would ten or eleven be best?"," I would love to have an eleven o'clock appointment."," Great, I'll just add you in, if that works."," Perfect, I appreciate that."," So happy that we had an opening for you."," I can't make my appointment and need to make another one. "," That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you."," Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would be good for me."," I can give you Friday; would you prefer ten or eleven? "," Ten o'clock is perfect."," Well, in that case, I'll just write you in."," Thanks. That will work out well."," It was my pleasure to have been able to make it work."," Excuse me for being late to work."," Where have you been?"," My car broke down."," That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again."," Yes, I'll work on it."," Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project "," Great! Fill me in."," Let's take a look at the Campbell Project."," I don't understand the projected revenues."," Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand."," I am sorry I am so late to work."," What was the problem?"," I lost track of time."," Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit."," It won't happen again."," All right, please take this message and call this client."," No problem."," Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?"," Yes, I understand the numbers."," I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late."," I lost track of time, am I late?"," Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?"," My friend needed me to help him."," I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on."," My apologies."," I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting."," Sure, I'll sit right here."," Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?"," I am confused about the projected revenues."," I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more."," When do you think they will finally arrive?"," I think maybe by Tuesday."," If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?"," I could try another supplier down the street."," That would work for me."," OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going."," Thank you for taking care of the problem."," Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client."," I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?"," I am not sure."," I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?"," I could order them from another supplier as a back-up."," That is a good plan."," I appreciate you staying on it."," We appreciate your business and aim to please."," Fine, what day will the whole order be here?"," If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow."," Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?"," Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure."," I appreciate that suggestion."," I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives."," I look forward to hearing from you."," What does she look like?"," Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!"," What do you mean, scary?"," Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?"," Yes, I know what you mean."," No, that's impossible!"," Are you crazy?"," Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?"," Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies."," I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?"," I liked Darth Vader."," They were very beautiful."," Yeah, I know what you mean!"," Can you describe her for me?"," She was large, hairy, and scary!"," What are you talking about?"," Yes, one time I met someone like that."," Sure, I think it could happen."," No, I never want to be near a UFO!"," Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?"," No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies."," I like Luke Skywalker."," He looked like a black vacuum cleaner."," I totally agree!"," How does she look?"," I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!"," Is this a joke?"," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," Yes, I believe in UFOs."," I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?"," Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating."," I saw some of them."," I like Yoda."," He was hot!"," That's a really good description."," Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?"," It is in the park downtown."," Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?"," We will need it for Saturday only."," I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?"," Mary and I will be driving the van."," Could you drop it off on Sunday night?"," Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?"," I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?"," It will be at the beach by the pier."," What day will you need it for?"," We will only be needing it for Sunday."," Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it."," The only two drivers will be Mary and I."," OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest."," That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?"," It is in the hotel ballroom down the street."," Do you need it for the whole weekend?"," We will need it for both days."," We will need to know who will be driving the van."," The van will be driven by Mary and me."," It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?"," I agree, I think that that would be perfect!"," I was thinking it could take place sometime in January."," That might be a little too cold for some people."," Yes, you are right."," What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot."," Yes, that would work out better."," You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone."," Good idea! We'll have to get right on it."," Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!"," What a great idea!"," January would be a good month for a mountain retreat."," I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January."," You know, now that I think about it, you might be right."," That is a good suggestion."," We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them."," Yes, that would let us know what would work best."," I'll put the survey online this afternoon."," The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat."," That's a wonderful choice."," I have chosen January as the month for this retreat."," January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays."," Yes, maybe another choice might be better."," Thank you for thinking of that."," Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer."," That is a good idea."," I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers."," I was thinking about applying for the new position."," Do you think that is a good idea?"," It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure."," What are your main concerns?"," I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself."," I also am thinking about the pay."," Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?"," Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain."," I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you."," Why are you considering trying for it?"," I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it."," What is it about this job that appeals to you?"," Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider."," I am also wondering about the pay."," Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?"," I am thinking that might be the case."," Are you certain that that is what you want to do."," It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it."," Why do you think that this would be a good move?"," Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change."," Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration."," Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice."," I think you definitely should apply for the position."," Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!"," Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?"," I love anything with chocolate the best."," I like chocolate myself."," Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?"," I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it."," I haven't ever cared for that myself."," Have you ever had garlic ice cream?"," That sounds absolutely disgusting!"," It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though."," There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!"," Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?"," I love fruit flavored ices the best."," Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever."," What is your least favorite ice cream?"," I don't like peppermint ice cream."," Yes, I know what you mean."," One time, I tried garlic ice cream."," That could be interesting."," That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!"," I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!"," There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?"," Vanilla with toppings is my favorite."," Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?"," No way!"," I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it."," I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me."," I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once."," I think that that would be horrible!"," I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!"," I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday."," I could help you with that."," Are you sure you have the time?"," What would be the best time for you to help me?"," Tomorrow night would work for me."," Should we just meet here?"," OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation."," I'll see you then."," See you tomorrow night."," Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?"," I would love to help you prepare for your presentation."," I hate to ask you to do something like that."," This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that."," When could we get together?"," I could easily give you some time tomorrow night."," Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?"," Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?"," I'll come prepared."," Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet."," I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday."," If you would like me to, I could help you with that."," Wouldn't that take you away from your project?"," I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me."," Is there a good time for you to help me?"," If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday."," How about meeting in my office?"," That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have."," Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot."," Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!"],[" There are many ways; what kind of job would you like?"," I want to work in a restaurant."," Fine!

How many years have you been with the company?"," I just started working here."," I'd like to, but I am very busy."," What can I do to help you?"," I could do some typing for you."," That would be a good place to start."," I like your positive attitude. How many years have you been employed here?"," I have worked here long time."," I'm not sure. Let me think about it."," Can you help me with my timesheet?"," Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept?"," No, I don't know where to find one."," Yes, I can do that."," No, I don't know what that is."," Yes, I understand how to do this."," That was easy!"," Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on."," How do we do timesheets here?"," Yes, I already have one."," I am kind of confused."," I'm not quite sure."," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box."," Thanks for your help."," Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later."," I need help with my timesheet."," OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?"," Yes, I have seen them."," Yes, I understand what to do."," What? Huh?"," Huh? What?"," Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in."," I thought you said this was easy."," You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this."," I need help figuring out how to use this phone."," Yes, I hear the tone."," OK. Now you dial 9 on the keypad.

Can you show me how?"," Yes, now what do I do?"," Well, after you dial 9 on the keypad, you should hear the tone change."," No, nothing changed."," I am trying to call my boss."," I know a few extensions but I don't know all of them."," You can always look an extension up on the company website."," I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting."," I would like to meet on Monday."," Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?"," I want to come in the morning."," Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting."," I think that we should have just the sub-committee."," No, I need directions, please."," Could I meet with you to discuss the project?"," Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?"," Tuesday would be good for me."," OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?"," I think the afternoon would be best."," Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting."," I feel that the whole committee needs to be there."," Yes, I know how to get there on my own."," When could we meet to discuss the project?"," I will be available on Monday or Tuesday.

"," That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you."," Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would be good for me."," I can give you Friday; would you prefer ten or eleven? "," Ten o'clock is perfect."," Well, in that case, I'll just write you in."," Thanks. That will work out well."," It was my pleasure to have been able to make it work."," Excuse me for being late to work."," Where have you been?"," My car broke down."," That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again."," Yes, I'll work on it."," Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project "," Great! Fill me in."," Let's take a look at the Campbell Project."," I don't understand the projected revenues."," Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand."," I am sorry I am so late to work."," What was the problem?"," I lost track of time."," Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit."," It won't happen again."," All right, please take this message and call this client."," No problem."," Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?"," Yes, I understand the numbers."," I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late."," I lost track of time, am I late?"," Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?"," My friend needed me to help him."," I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on."," My apologies."," I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting."," Sure, I'll sit right here."," Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?"," I am confused about the projected revenues."," I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more."," When do you think they will finally arrive?"," I think maybe by Tuesday."," If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?"," I could try another supplier down the street."," That would work for me."," OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going."," Thank you for taking care of the problem."," Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client."," I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?"," I am not sure."," I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?"," I could order them from another supplier as a back-up."," That is a good plan."," I appreciate you staying on it."," We appreciate your business and aim to please."," Fine, what day will the whole order be here?"," If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow."," Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?"," Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure."," I appreciate that suggestion."," I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives."," I look forward to hearing from you."," What does she look like?"," Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!"," What do you mean, scary?"," Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?"," Yes, I know what you mean."," No, that's impossible!"," Are you crazy?"," Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?"," Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies."," I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?"," I liked Darth Vader."," They were very beautiful."," Yeah, I know what you mean!"," Can you describe her for me?"," She was large, hairy, and scary!"," What are you talking about?"," Yes, one time I met someone like that."," Sure, I think it could happen."," No, I never want to be near a UFO!"," Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?"," No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies."," I like Luke Skywalker."," He looked like a black vacuum cleaner."," I totally agree!"," How does she look?"," I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!"," Is this a joke?"," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," Yes, I believe in UFOs."," I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?"," Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating."," I saw some of them."," I like Yoda."," He was hot!"," That's a really good description."," Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?"," It is in the park downtown."," Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?"," We will need it for Saturday only."," I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?"," Mary and I will be driving the van."," Could you drop it off on Sunday night?"," Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?"," I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?"," It will be at the beach by the pier."," What day will you need it for?"," We will only be needing it for Sunday."," Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it."," The only two drivers will be Mary and I."," OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest."," That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?"," It is in the hotel ballroom down the street."," Do you need it for the whole weekend?"," We will need it for both days."," We will need to know who will be driving the van."," The van will be driven by Mary and me."," It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?"," I agree, I think that that would be perfect!"," I was thinking it could take place sometime in January."," That might be a little too cold for some people."," Yes, you are right."," What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot."," Yes, that would work out better."," You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone."," Good idea! We'll have to get right on it."," Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!"," What a great idea!"," January would be a good month for a mountain retreat."," I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January."," You know, now that I think about it, you might be right."," That is a good suggestion."," We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them."," Yes, that would let us know what would work best."," I'll put the survey online this afternoon."," The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat."," That's a wonderful choice."," I have chosen January as the month for this retreat."," January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays."," Yes, maybe another choice might be better."," Thank you for thinking of that."," Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer."," That is a good idea."," I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers."," I was thinking about applying for the new position."," Do you think that is a good idea?"," It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure."," What are your main concerns?"," I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself."," I also am thinking about the pay."," Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?"," Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain."," I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you."," Why are you considering trying for it?"," I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it."," What is it about this job that appeals to you?"," Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider."," I am also wondering about the pay."," Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?"," I am thinking that might be the case."," Are you certain that that is what you want to do."," It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it."," Why do you think that this would be a good move?"," Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change."," Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration."," Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice."," I think you definitely should apply for the position."," Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!"," Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?"," I love anything with chocolate the best."," I like chocolate myself."," Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?"," I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it."," I haven't ever cared for that myself."," Have you ever had garlic ice cream?"," That sounds absolutely disgusting!"," It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though."," There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!"," Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?"," I love fruit flavored ices the best."," Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever."," What is your least favorite ice cream?"," I don't like peppermint ice cream."," Yes, I know what you mean."," One time, I tried garlic ice cream."," That could be interesting."," That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!"," I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!"," There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?"," Vanilla with toppings is my favorite."," Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?"," No way!"," I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it."," I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me."," I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once."," I think that that would be horrible!"," I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!"," I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday."," I could help you with that."," Are you sure you have the time?"," What would be the best time for you to help me?"," Tomorrow night would work for me."," Should we just meet here?"," OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation."," I'll see you then."," See you tomorrow night."," Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?"," I would love to help you prepare for your presentation."," I hate to ask you to do something like that."," This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that."," When could we get together?"," I could easily give you some time tomorrow night."," Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?"," Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?"," I'll come prepared."," Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet."," I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday."," If you would like me to, I could help you with that."," Wouldn't that take you away from your project?"," I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me."," Is there a good time for you to help me?"," If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday."," How about meeting in my office?"," That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have."," Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot."," Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!"],[" There are many ways; what kind of job would you like?"," I want to work in a restaurant."," Fine!

Have you found the blank ones?"," Yes, I have seen them."," Yes, I understand what to do."," What? Huh?"," Huh? What?"," Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in."," I thought you said this was easy."," You are a quick learner.

Are mornings or afternoons best?"," I want to come in the morning."," Yes, I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting."," I think that we should have just the sub-committee."," No, I need directions, please."," Could I meet with you to discuss the project?"," Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer?"," Tuesday would be good for me."," OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?"," I think the afternoon would be best."," Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting."," I feel that the whole committee needs to be there."," Yes, I know how to get there on my own."," When could we meet to discuss the project?"," I will be available on Monday or Tuesday.

"," That's OK, we can reschedule it if you tell me what day works for you."," Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would be good for me."," I can give you Friday; would you prefer ten or eleven? "," Ten o'clock is perfect."," Well, in that case, I'll just write you in."," Thanks. That will work out well."," It was my pleasure to have been able to make it work."," Excuse me for being late to work."," Where have you been?"," My car broke down."," That's too bad. Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again."," Yes, I'll work on it."," Thank you, have a seat. We are working on the new project "," Great! Fill me in."," Let's take a look at the Campbell Project."," I don't understand the projected revenues."," Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand."," I am sorry I am so late to work."," What was the problem?"," I lost track of time."," Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit."," It won't happen again."," All right, please take this message and call this client."," No problem."," Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?"," Yes, I understand the numbers."," I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late."," I lost track of time, am I late?"," Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?"," My friend needed me to help him."," I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on."," My apologies."," I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting."," Sure, I'll sit right here."," Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?"," I am confused about the projected revenues."," I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more."," When do you think they will finally arrive?"," I think maybe by Tuesday."," If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?"," I could try another supplier down the street."," That would work for me."," OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going."," Thank you for taking care of the problem."," Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client."," I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?"," I am not sure."," I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?"," I could order them from another supplier as a back-up."," That is a good plan."," I appreciate you staying on it."," We appreciate your business and aim to please."," Fine, what day will the whole order be here?"," If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow."," Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?"," Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure."," I appreciate that suggestion."," I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives."," I look forward to hearing from you."," What does she look like?"," Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!"," What do you mean, scary?"," Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?"," Yes, I know what you mean."," No, that's impossible!"," Are you crazy?"," Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?"," Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies."," I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?"," I liked Darth Vader."," They were very beautiful."," Yeah, I know what you mean!"," Can you describe her for me?"," She was large, hairy, and scary!"," What are you talking about?"," Yes, one time I met someone like that."," Sure, I think it could happen."," No, I never want to be near a UFO!"," Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?"," No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies."," I like Luke Skywalker."," He looked like a black vacuum cleaner."," I totally agree!"," How does she look?"," I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!"," Is this a joke?"," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," Yes, I believe in UFOs."," I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?"," Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating."," I saw some of them."," I like Yoda."," He was hot!"," That's a really good description."," Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?"," It is in the park downtown."," Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?"," We will need it for Saturday only."," I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?"," Mary and I will be driving the van."," Could you drop it off on Sunday night?"," Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?"," I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?"," It will be at the beach by the pier."," What day will you need it for?"," We will only be needing it for Sunday."," Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it."," The only two drivers will be Mary and I."," OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest."," That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?"," It is in the hotel ballroom down the street."," Do you need it for the whole weekend?"," We will need it for both days."," We will need to know who will be driving the van."," The van will be driven by Mary and me."," It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?"," I agree, I think that that would be perfect!"," I was thinking it could take place sometime in January."," That might be a little too cold for some people."," Yes, you are right."," What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot."," Yes, that would work out better."," You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone."," Good idea! We'll have to get right on it."," Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!"," What a great idea!"," January would be a good month for a mountain retreat."," I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January."," You know, now that I think about it, you might be right."," That is a good suggestion."," We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them."," Yes, that would let us know what would work best."," I'll put the survey online this afternoon."," The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat."," That's a wonderful choice."," I have chosen January as the month for this retreat."," January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays."," Yes, maybe another choice might be better."," Thank you for thinking of that."," Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer."," That is a good idea."," I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers."," I was thinking about applying for the new position."," Do you think that is a good idea?"," It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure."," What are your main concerns?"," I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself."," I also am thinking about the pay."," Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?"," Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain."," I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you."," Why are you considering trying for it?"," I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it."," What is it about this job that appeals to you?"," Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider."," I am also wondering about the pay."," Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?"," I am thinking that might be the case."," Are you certain that that is what you want to do."," It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it."," Why do you think that this would be a good move?"," Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change."," Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration."," Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice."," I think you definitely should apply for the position."," Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!"," Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?"," I love anything with chocolate the best."," I like chocolate myself."," Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?"," I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it."," I haven't ever cared for that myself."," Have you ever had garlic ice cream?"," That sounds absolutely disgusting!"," It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though."," There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!"," Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?"," I love fruit flavored ices the best."," Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever."," What is your least favorite ice cream?"," I don't like peppermint ice cream."," Yes, I know what you mean."," One time, I tried garlic ice cream."," That could be interesting."," That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!"," I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!"," There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?"," Vanilla with toppings is my favorite."," Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?"," No way!"," I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it."," I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me."," I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once."," I think that that would be horrible!"," I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!"," I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday."," I could help you with that."," Are you sure you have the time?"," What would be the best time for you to help me?"," Tomorrow night would work for me."," Should we just meet here?"," OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation."," I'll see you then."," See you tomorrow night."," Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?"," I would love to help you prepare for your presentation."," I hate to ask you to do something like that."," This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that."," When could we get together?"," I could easily give you some time tomorrow night."," Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?"," Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?"," I'll come prepared."," Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet."," I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday."," If you would like me to, I could help you with that."," Wouldn't that take you away from your project?"," I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me."," Is there a good time for you to help me?"," If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday."," How about meeting in my office?"," That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have."," Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot."," Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!"],[" There are many ways; what kind of job would you like?"," I want to work in a restaurant."," Fine!

Have you found the blank ones?"," Yes, I have seen them."," Yes, I understand what to do."," What? Huh?"," Huh? What?"," Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in."," I thought you said this was easy."," You are a quick learner.

Fill me in."," Let's take a look at the Campbell Project."," I don't understand the projected revenues."," Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand."," I am sorry I am so late to work."," What was the problem?"," I lost track of time."," Things happen; make sure it doesn't become a habit."," It won't happen again."," All right, please take this message and call this client."," No problem."," Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board?"," Yes, I understand the numbers."," I will explain it again; especially for those of you who arrived late."," I lost track of time, am I late?"," Yes. What kept you from arriving on time?"," My friend needed me to help him."," I realize that everyone has emergencies; just get here on time from now on."," My apologies."," I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting."," Sure, I'll sit right here."," Wonderful, does anyone have any questions about this project?"," I am confused about the projected revenues."," I'm glad that some of you get it, but let's go over it once more."," When do you think they will finally arrive?"," I think maybe by Tuesday."," If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?"," I could try another supplier down the street."," That would work for me."," OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going."," Thank you for taking care of the problem."," Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client."," I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?"," I am not sure."," I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?"," I could order them from another supplier as a back-up."," That is a good plan."," I appreciate you staying on it."," We appreciate your business and aim to please."," Fine, what day will the whole order be here?"," If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow."," Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?"," Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure."," I appreciate that suggestion."," I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives."," I look forward to hearing from you."," What does she look like?"," Well, she was pretty tall, about 5 feet 10 inches and kind of scary looking!"," What do you mean, scary?"," Well, she had a crazy sounding laugh and wild hair. Do you know what I mean?"," Yes, I know what you mean."," No, that's impossible!"," Are you crazy?"," Hah, I guess we never know what can happen. Do you like Star Wars movies?"," Yes, I have seen all of the Star Wars movies."," I loved Star Wars movies. My favorite character was Yoda. What about you?"," I liked Darth Vader."," They were very beautiful."," Yeah, I know what you mean!"," Can you describe her for me?"," She was large, hairy, and scary!"," What are you talking about?"," Yes, one time I met someone like that."," Sure, I think it could happen."," No, I never want to be near a UFO!"," Well, you will probably never see one. Have you seen any Star Wars movies?"," No, I haven't seen any Star Wars movies."," I like Luke Skywalker."," He looked like a black vacuum cleaner."," I totally agree!"," How does she look?"," I am not sure how tall she was but she was very scary!"," Is this a joke?"," No, I have no idea what you are talking about."," Yes, I believe in UFOs."," I've never seen a UFO but I would like to. How about you?"," Yes, I think that seeing a UFO would be fascinating."," I saw some of them."," I like Yoda."," He was hot!"," That's a really good description."," Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?"," It is in the park downtown."," Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?"," We will need it for Saturday only."," I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?"," Mary and I will be driving the van."," Could you drop it off on Sunday night?"," Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?"," I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?"," It will be at the beach by the pier."," What day will you need it for?"," We will only be needing it for Sunday."," Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it."," The only two drivers will be Mary and I."," OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest."," That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?"," It is in the hotel ballroom down the street."," Do you need it for the whole weekend?"," We will need it for both days."," We will need to know who will be driving the van."," The van will be driven by Mary and me."," It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?"," I agree, I think that that would be perfect!"," I was thinking it could take place sometime in January."," That might be a little too cold for some people."," Yes, you are right."," What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot."," Yes, that would work out better."," You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone."," Good idea! We'll have to get right on it."," Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!"," What a great idea!"," January would be a good month for a mountain retreat."," I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January."," You know, now that I think about it, you might be right."," That is a good suggestion."," We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them."," Yes, that would let us know what would work best."," I'll put the survey online this afternoon."," The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat."," That's a wonderful choice."," I have chosen January as the month for this retreat."," January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays."," Yes, maybe another choice might be better."," Thank you for thinking of that."," Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer."," That is a good idea."," I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers."," I was thinking about applying for the new position."," Do you think that is a good idea?"," It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure."," What are your main concerns?"," I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself."," I also am thinking about the pay."," Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?"," Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain."," I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you."," Why are you considering trying for it?"," I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it."," What is it about this job that appeals to you?"," Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider."," I am also wondering about the pay."," Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?"," I am thinking that might be the case."," Are you certain that that is what you want to do."," It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it."," Why do you think that this would be a good move?"," Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change."," Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration."," Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice."," I think you definitely should apply for the position."," Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!"," Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?"," I love anything with chocolate the best."," I like chocolate myself."," Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?"," I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it."," I haven't ever cared for that myself."," Have you ever had garlic ice cream?"," That sounds absolutely disgusting!"," It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though."," There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!"," Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?"," I love fruit flavored ices the best."," Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever."," What is your least favorite ice cream?"," I don't like peppermint ice cream."," Yes, I know what you mean."," One time, I tried garlic ice cream."," That could be interesting."," That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!"," I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!"," There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?"," Vanilla with toppings is my favorite."," Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?"," No way!"," I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it."," I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me."," I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once."," I think that that would be horrible!"," I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!"," I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday."," I could help you with that."," Are you sure you have the time?"," What would be the best time for you to help me?"," Tomorrow night would work for me."," Should we just meet here?"," OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation."," I'll see you then."," See you tomorrow night."," Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?"," I would love to help you prepare for your presentation."," I hate to ask you to do something like that."," This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that."," When could we get together?"," I could easily give you some time tomorrow night."," Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?"," Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?"," I'll come prepared."," Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet."," I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday."," If you would like me to, I could help you with that."," Wouldn't that take you away from your project?"," I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me."," Is there a good time for you to help me?"," If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday."," How about meeting in my office?"," That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have."," Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot."," Don't worry. Everything will go well.

So where should I start my sightseeing?"," The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin."," Hmm. What type of interests do you have?"," In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running."," Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?"," No, but I've heard a lot about both."," Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot."," I'm sure you'll have a good time there."," I was told to see you about going sightseeing."," It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service."," Concierge? Could you explain that to me?"," We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop."," Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?"," I would suggest the Statue of Liberty."," Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?"," Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?"," I really like to run. And I like art."," No, but I've been meaning to."," That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that."," Enjoy your run and your visit!"," I need some sightseeing advice."," That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me."," I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?"," That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?"," I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty."," You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?"," Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time."," When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums."," No, but I sure would like to."," Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today."," Enjoy the views at both places."," I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first."," Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word."," That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?"," I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else."," Sure! Tell me about your interests."," I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters."," No, I just haven't had the opportunity."," Thank you. That's what I'll do."," This might be the best day of your visit."," I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you."," As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir."," Concierge? Are we speaking English here?"," What would you suggest that I visit first?"," I think so. Tell me what interests you."," I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running."," No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them."," Thank you. That's great advice."," This might be the best day of your visit."," Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? "," What in the world is a concierge?"," Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?"," Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?"," I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?"," I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums."," No, although I've heard great things about both of them."," Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here."," This is a day you're going to remember for a long time."," I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan."," Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?"," No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?"," As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there."," Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?"," Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?"," My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best."," That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?"," Of course, sir. You've made a good choice."," I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?"," She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her."," I'm already dialing, sir."," But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?"," She deserves nothing but the best, of course."," Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time."," My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?"," She will want an excellent restaurant, of course."," I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?"," At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you."," Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!"," Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge."," I'd like to order dinner."," What would you like?"," I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do."," And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," That's fine."," It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir."," Could I order dinner?"," Of course. What would you like?"," I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay."," Not tonight, thank you."," No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay."," Charge it to whatever account you like."," Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!"," Could you bring me some food, please?"," Sure. What do you fancy?"," No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then."," Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion."," Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?"," No problem."," Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it."," I'd like you to bring me some food."," Just name it, sir."," Sure, I love porterhouse, too."," I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries."," Go right ahead."," Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible."," I need something to eat, please."," Tell me what you're hungry for."," I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too."," Just the champagne will be fine, thank you."," You'll see this charge on your amenities account."," That's fine."," It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it."," Can I order something from the kitchen?"," Just tell me what you'd like, please."," Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!"," Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? "," Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. "," Not a problem."," I have a little problem with room 507."," What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?"," I found cockroaches in my room."," Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable."," I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room."," Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?"," I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room."," What is that problem, sir?"," There are cockroaches in my room."," Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?"," Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel."," You dare to doubt me?"," I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor."," There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507."," Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?"," I have cockroaches crawling in my room."," Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir."," I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see."," Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?"," How dare you question my statement!"," There's a major problem with room 507."," I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem."," This room is overrun with cockroaches."," There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir."," I stopped counting at nine."," I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. "," I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir."," Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches."," Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check."," The next cockroach I see will be number ten."," Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach."," I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!"," You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor."," I have a little problem with room 507."," Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem."," This room is filthy with cockroaches. "," Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?"," I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! "," Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots."," You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!"," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," And the problem is, sir?"," Cockroaches have taken over my room!"," Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others."," We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible."," I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight."," I'm sorry, sir. Exactly what is the problem?"," I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact."," Sir, we always try to please our guests."," I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight."," Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is."," I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!"," Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court."," Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy."," Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?"," I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!"," Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience."," Sir, our guests are our reason for being."," Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir."," In a word, cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars."," Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing."," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful."," Cockroaches have declared war on my room!"," Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do."," Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness."," Where is your fitness facility located?"," Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?"," What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?"," The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day."," Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?"," Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym."," Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness."," Great! Where is it?"," Do I have to pay extra?"," No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in."," What are the gym hours?"," You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7."," Great! Is a trainer available?"," Does this hotel have an exercise facility?"," But of course! We have a great exercise facility."," Good. Now exactly where is it?"," Is this going to cost me anything?"," When does the gym open and close?"," The hours couldn't be better, 24/7."," Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there?"," I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't."," Do you have a place where I can exercise?"," Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility."," I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is?"," Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?"," And the gym hours are?"," Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes."," One more question: Do you have a trainer?"," We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no."," Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?"," Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory."," So, where do I go to exercise?"," It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs."," Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?"," Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key."," Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?"," Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week."," Do you have a trainer to help me work out?"," I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer."," I'd like to request some more amenities."," Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?"," The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc."," I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?"," Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days."," Then what is the problem, sir?"," I need some to keep as souvenirs!"," Souvenirs?"," Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!"," We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir."," That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!"," I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly."," I need more amenities, please."," Could you be a little more specific, sir?"," To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo."," No! I've got all I need for my stay here."," So, what's the problem?"," I need souvenirs!"," You want some souvenirs!"," Yes, yes. Souvenirs."," But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items."," How do I get more amenities?"," I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand."," I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities."," No, no. I've got plenty left."," Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?"," What am I going to do about souvenirs?"," Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!"," Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs."," Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs."," Yes, I need more amenities."," By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?"," You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo."," Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?"," No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day."," I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?"," I need to take home some souvenirs!"," Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!"," Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection."," Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?"," I need some more amenities, please."," I'm not sure I'm following you, sir."," Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?"," No, I'm not even halfway through my supply."," I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?"," What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?"," Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!"," There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs."," Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items."," Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily."," I need to copy a document immediately."," We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor."," Great! How much is it for a copy?"," The price per copy is ten cents."," That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately."," THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir."," I need to copy something right now."," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir."," Great! How much per copy?"," Sir, one copy is ten cents."," I'll be down there shortly."," You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir."," I need to make a copy of something at once."," There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir."," Fantastic! Is there a charge?"," It's ten cents a copy, sir."," I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it."," A dime is still a bargain, sir."," I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible."," No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab."," Very good. How much does each copy cost?"," Each copy will cost you a dime, sir."," A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel."," There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir."," Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?"," Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. "," That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? "," Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. "," In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down."," Those were the good old days, sir, indeed."," I need a doctor immediately!"," Sir, is everything all right?"," My wife just collapsed on the floor!"," Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths."," I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room."," Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line."," What's taking you so long?"," I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm."," Help me! I need a doctor!"," What is the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor!"," Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath."," I need some help, right now!"," Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911."," Hurry, please!"," I'm transferring you right now, sir."," I need a doctor right now!"," Tell me the problem, sir."," My wife just passed out!"," Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!"," I'm getting 911 on another line, sir."," Okay, but hurry."," Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly."," Get a doctor here, immediately!"," What's the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!"," Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?"," Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!"," Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911."," Hurry up, please."," I'm connecting you now, sir."," A doctor! I need a doctor! "," Give me some details, sir."," Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor."," Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. "," You're right, I'm beside myself with worry."," Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911."," Time is critical. Hurry up!"," I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911."," I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop."," That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them."," Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives."," We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor."," Very good. How much does that cost?"," I see. And the other alternatives?"," Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?"," You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."," I need broadband for my computer."," That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only."," Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested."," Go ahead. I'm all ears."," We have a computer lab on the first floor."," That's great! How much is it?"," It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course."," What about the other alternatives?"," You could use your wireless right here in our lobby."," Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?"," Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab."," I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband."," I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only."," That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have."," Any alternative that works will be great."," Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor."," That sounds good. What's the charge?"," That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?"," I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup."," In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives."," Anything to get me up and running."," For starters, we have a computer lab."," Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?"," That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives."," Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?"," Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs."," How do I get online with my laptop?"," I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only."," No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives."," Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. "," Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor."," Great! But is it free?"," You said there were other alternatives?"," Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless."," I'd like to order a restock on my minibar."," You finished everything in there, sir?"," Absolutely everything. "," What would you like to order?"," Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," Uh-huh. What else do you want?"," The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?"," No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?"," Some grape juice would also be nice."," I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly."," I need my minibar restocked."," Everything is gone, sir?"," There's not a drop left of anything."," Is there anything in particular you'd like?"," Got it. Anything else?"," I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please."," Not a problem. Anything else?"," Yes, one more thing: some grape juice."," Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir."," My minibar is empty."," You already finished off everything, sir?"," I finished off everything."," Would you like anything in particular?"," The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each."," Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?"," I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please."," Sure thing. Might there by anything else?"," Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too."," How do I restock my minibar?"," You've drunk everything, sir?"," I finished it all."," Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?"," Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?"," The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please."," Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?"," You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too."," Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door."," My minibar is completely empty."," Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?"," Everything's gone. "," Is there anything special you'd like?"," Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier."," Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?"," The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please."," Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?"," Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice."," Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir."," Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?"," What exactly does that mean?"," That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?"," If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations."," Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?"," I'll go down there as soon as I can!"," Does this hotel have a pool?"," I'm not sure I understand."," Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current."," Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?"," Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations."," Excellent! Now what are the hours?"," The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only."," I'm going to change into my trunks right now!"," I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout."," Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?"," We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym."," I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?"," It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against."," Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?"," As a guest, sir, you pay nothing."," This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?"," Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!"," I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here."," This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?"," You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill."," All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?"," The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge."," Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?"," They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week."," Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!"," I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet."," We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?"," Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?"," The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir."," Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?"," The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m."," Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks."," Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded."," I need to get a taxi."," No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi."," Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel."," Just a taxi, please."," And what is your destination?"," I'm going to Rockefeller Center."," I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?"," I want to leave as soon as possible."," Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir."," Thank you, I'm coming down now."," It won't be but a few seconds, sir."," I need a taxi, please."," No, thanks. A taxi is just fine."," May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while."," I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you."," I understand. And where will you be going?"," Rockefeller Center."," And what time would you like to be picked up?"," The sooner the better."," A taxi will be here shortly, sir."," Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo."," A taxi it is, sir."," Can you get me a taxi?"," Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine."," In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style."," No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers."," Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?"," My destination is Rockefeller Center."," What time do you want to leave the hotel?"," As soon as possible."," I'll call the taxi immediately, sir."," I'm coming downstairs now."," A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir."," I'm going to need a taxi."," A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay."," Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi."," No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo."," No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?"," I'm headed to Rockefeller Center."," When shall I tell the taxi to be here?"," Right now."," The taxi will be here immediately, sir."," Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute."," You won't have to wait a second, sir."," I need a taxi."," We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer."," No, the taxi will do."," Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine."," No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine."," No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?"," I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center."," What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?"," I'm ready to go right now."," I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir."," Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs."," You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir."," Could you please reserve a taxi for me?"," Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?"," A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one."," Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?"," T A X I, please."," A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? "," Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?"," A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir."," Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs."," The taxi will be ready when you are, sir."," I am checking out. Here is the key to my room."," Thanks."," If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?"," I want to check out. Here is my room key."," One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are."," Thanks."," May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?"," I'm leaving. Here is my key."," Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go."," Thank you very much."," Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?"," Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic."," I'm out of here. Here's my key."," I thank you."," I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir."," I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home."," My stay is over. Here's the key to my room."," Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir."," Many thanks."," I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir."," This visit is over for me. Here's your room key."," Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt."," And thanks to you."," I hope you'll visit us again, sir."," That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night."," Okay, let me see what I can do."," Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple."," Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed."," This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!"," I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters."," I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered."," Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching \"Titanic\" Monday night."," That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night."," Okay, sir, bear with me a moment."," Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word."," You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," I feel your pain, sir."," Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. "," I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here."," You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw."," Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched \"Titanic\" Monday evening."," The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night."," Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please."," I knew you'd see it my way."," Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill."," Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?"," Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer."," This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!"," If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way."," Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?"," Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching \"Titanic.\""," The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night."," Thank you for taking care of it so quickly."," You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!"," Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir."," Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!"," I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money."," Hmm. Your file shows that you watched \"Titanic\" Monday night."," Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert."," Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly."," When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge."," Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5."," Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?"," Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not."," I'm checking out in about half an hour."," Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir."," Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m."," My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?"," Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though."," Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment."," Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour."," I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes."," I'm ready when you are, sir."," Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York."," You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine."," A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?"," Let me think about this."," Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes."," Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?"," Just say the word, sir."," Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun."," I agree. The dew is still on the grass."," Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?"," Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit."," I'll have to think about this for a second."," Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away."," In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour."," That won't be a problem, sir."," That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me."," You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you."," We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit."," A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit."," Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems."," That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute."," Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time."," I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes."," Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you."," Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," There's nothing like getting an early start, sir."," What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?"," You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit."," Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?"," I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card."," It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. "," I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?"," All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up."," All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?"," That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!"," I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?"," That sounds great, sir. Thank you."," Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?"," How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?"," Perfect. Thank you for doing that."," No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by."," I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you."," Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you."," A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?"," Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you."," I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. "," Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home."," You're welcome."," I need to cancel my reservation. I have personal matters that need fixing."," Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, April 9 through 15."," Thank you. I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother."," It's a pleasure."," I made a reservation earlier this week, but I have to cancel it."," That was nice and fast. Thanks."," Not at all."," All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date."," Thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can."," It's been my pleasure to help you."," My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made."," I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth."," I wish everything in life was so simple, thank you."," Not a problem, sir.

"," We're here all night long if you need anything."," The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice."," Concierge? What exactly is that?"," Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?"," The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin."," Hmm. What type of interests do you have?"," In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running."," Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?"," No, but I've heard a lot about both."," Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot."," I'm sure you'll have a good time there."," I was told to see you about going sightseeing."," It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service."," Concierge? Could you explain that to me?"," We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop."," Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?"," I would suggest the Statue of Liberty."," Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?"," Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?"," I really like to run. And I like art."," No, but I've been meaning to."," That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that."," Enjoy your run and your visit!"," I need some sightseeing advice."," That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me."," I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?"," That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?"," I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty."," You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?"," Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time."," When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums."," No, but I sure would like to."," Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today."," Enjoy the views at both places."," I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first."," Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word."," That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?"," I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else."," Sure! Tell me about your interests."," I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters."," No, I just haven't had the opportunity."," Thank you. That's what I'll do."," This might be the best day of your visit."," I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you."," As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir."," Concierge? Are we speaking English here?"," What would you suggest that I visit first?"," I think so. Tell me what interests you."," I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running."," No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them."," Thank you. That's great advice."," This might be the best day of your visit."," Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? "," What in the world is a concierge?"," Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?"," Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?"," I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?"," I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums."," No, although I've heard great things about both of them."," Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here."," This is a day you're going to remember for a long time."," I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan."," Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?"," No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?"," As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there."," Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?"," Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?"," My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best."," That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?"," Of course, sir. You've made a good choice."," I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?"," She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her."," I'm already dialing, sir."," But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?"," She deserves nothing but the best, of course."," Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time."," My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?"," She will want an excellent restaurant, of course."," I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?"," At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you."," Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!"," Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge."," I'd like to order dinner."," What would you like?"," I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do."," And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," That's fine."," It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir."," Could I order dinner?"," Of course. What would you like?"," I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay."," Not tonight, thank you."," No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay."," Charge it to whatever account you like."," Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!"," Could you bring me some food, please?"," Sure. What do you fancy?"," No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then."," Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion."," Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?"," No problem."," Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it."," I'd like you to bring me some food."," Just name it, sir."," Sure, I love porterhouse, too."," I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries."," Go right ahead."," Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible."," I need something to eat, please."," Tell me what you're hungry for."," I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too."," Just the champagne will be fine, thank you."," You'll see this charge on your amenities account."," That's fine."," It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it."," Can I order something from the kitchen?"," Just tell me what you'd like, please."," Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!"," Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? "," Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. "," Not a problem."," I have a little problem with room 507."," What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?"," I found cockroaches in my room."," Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable."," I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room."," Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?"," I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room."," What is that problem, sir?"," There are cockroaches in my room."," Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?"," Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel."," You dare to doubt me?"," I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor."," There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507."," Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?"," I have cockroaches crawling in my room."," Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir."," I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see."," Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?"," How dare you question my statement!"," There's a major problem with room 507."," I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem."," This room is overrun with cockroaches."," There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir."," I stopped counting at nine."," I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. "," I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir."," Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches."," Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check."," The next cockroach I see will be number ten."," Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach."," I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!"," You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor."," I have a little problem with room 507."," Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem."," This room is filthy with cockroaches. "," Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?"," I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! "," Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots."," You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!"," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," And the problem is, sir?"," Cockroaches have taken over my room!"," Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others."," We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible."," I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight."," I'm sorry, sir. Exactly what is the problem?"," I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact."," Sir, we always try to please our guests."," I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight."," Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is."," I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!"," Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court."," Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy."," Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?"," I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!"," Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience."," Sir, our guests are our reason for being."," Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir."," In a word, cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars."," Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing."," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful."," Cockroaches have declared war on my room!"," Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do."," Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness."," Where is your fitness facility located?"," Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?"," What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?"," The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day."," Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?"," Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym."," Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness."," Great! Where is it?"," Do I have to pay extra?"," No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in."," What are the gym hours?"," You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7."," Great! Is a trainer available?"," Does this hotel have an exercise facility?"," But of course! We have a great exercise facility."," Good. Now exactly where is it?"," Is this going to cost me anything?"," When does the gym open and close?"," The hours couldn't be better, 24/7."," Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there?"," I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't."," Do you have a place where I can exercise?"," Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility."," I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is?"," Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?"," And the gym hours are?"," Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes."," One more question: Do you have a trainer?"," We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no."," Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?"," Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory."," So, where do I go to exercise?"," It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs."," Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?"," Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key."," Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?"," Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week."," Do you have a trainer to help me work out?"," I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer."," I'd like to request some more amenities."," Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?"," The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc."," I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?"," Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days."," Then what is the problem, sir?"," I need some to keep as souvenirs!"," Souvenirs?"," Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!"," We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir."," That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!"," I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly."," I need more amenities, please."," Could you be a little more specific, sir?"," To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo."," No! I've got all I need for my stay here."," So, what's the problem?"," I need souvenirs!"," You want some souvenirs!"," Yes, yes. Souvenirs."," But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items."," How do I get more amenities?"," I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand."," I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities."," No, no. I've got plenty left."," Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?"," What am I going to do about souvenirs?"," Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!"," Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs."," Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs."," Yes, I need more amenities."," By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?"," You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo."," Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?"," No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day."," I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?"," I need to take home some souvenirs!"," Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!"," Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection."," Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?"," I need some more amenities, please."," I'm not sure I'm following you, sir."," Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?"," No, I'm not even halfway through my supply."," I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?"," What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?"," Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!"," There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs."," Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items."," Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily."," I need to copy a document immediately."," We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor."," Great! How much is it for a copy?"," The price per copy is ten cents."," That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately."," THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir."," I need to copy something right now."," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir."," Great! How much per copy?"," Sir, one copy is ten cents."," I'll be down there shortly."," You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir."," I need to make a copy of something at once."," There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir."," Fantastic! Is there a charge?"," It's ten cents a copy, sir."," I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it."," A dime is still a bargain, sir."," I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible."," No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab."," Very good. How much does each copy cost?"," Each copy will cost you a dime, sir."," A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel."," There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir."," Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?"," Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. "," That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? "," Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. "," In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down."," Those were the good old days, sir, indeed."," I need a doctor immediately!"," Sir, is everything all right?"," My wife just collapsed on the floor!"," Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths."," I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room."," Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line."," What's taking you so long?"," I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm."," Help me! I need a doctor!"," What is the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor!"," Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath."," I need some help, right now!"," Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911."," Hurry, please!"," I'm transferring you right now, sir."," I need a doctor right now!"," Tell me the problem, sir."," My wife just passed out!"," Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!"," I'm getting 911 on another line, sir."," Okay, but hurry."," Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly."," Get a doctor here, immediately!"," What's the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!"," Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?"," Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!"," Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911."," Hurry up, please."," I'm connecting you now, sir."," A doctor! I need a doctor! "," Give me some details, sir."," Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor."," Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. "," You're right, I'm beside myself with worry."," Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911."," Time is critical. Hurry up!"," I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911."," I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop."," That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them."," Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives."," We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor."," Very good. How much does that cost?"," I see. And the other alternatives?"," Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?"," You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."," I need broadband for my computer."," That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only."," Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested."," Go ahead. I'm all ears."," We have a computer lab on the first floor."," That's great! How much is it?"," It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course."," What about the other alternatives?"," You could use your wireless right here in our lobby."," Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?"," Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab."," I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband."," I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only."," That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have."," Any alternative that works will be great."," Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor."," That sounds good. What's the charge?"," That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?"," I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup."," In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives."," Anything to get me up and running."," For starters, we have a computer lab."," Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?"," That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives."," Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?"," Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs."," How do I get online with my laptop?"," I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only."," No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives."," Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. "," Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor."," Great! But is it free?"," You said there were other alternatives?"," Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless."," I'd like to order a restock on my minibar."," You finished everything in there, sir?"," Absolutely everything. "," What would you like to order?"," Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," Uh-huh. What else do you want?"," The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?"," No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?"," Some grape juice would also be nice."," I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly."," I need my minibar restocked."," Everything is gone, sir?"," There's not a drop left of anything."," Is there anything in particular you'd like?"," Got it. Anything else?"," I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please."," Not a problem. Anything else?"," Yes, one more thing: some grape juice."," Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir."," My minibar is empty."," You already finished off everything, sir?"," I finished off everything."," Would you like anything in particular?"," The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each."," Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?"," I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please."," Sure thing. Might there by anything else?"," Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too."," How do I restock my minibar?"," You've drunk everything, sir?"," I finished it all."," Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?"," Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?"," The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please."," Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?"," You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too."," Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door."," My minibar is completely empty."," Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?"," Everything's gone. "," Is there anything special you'd like?"," Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier."," Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?"," The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please."," Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?"," Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice."," Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir."," Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?"," What exactly does that mean?"," That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?"," If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations."," Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?"," I'll go down there as soon as I can!"," Does this hotel have a pool?"," I'm not sure I understand."," Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current."," Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?"," Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations."," Excellent! Now what are the hours?"," The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only."," I'm going to change into my trunks right now!"," I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout."," Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?"," We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym."," I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?"," It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against."," Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?"," As a guest, sir, you pay nothing."," This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?"," Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!"," I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here."," This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?"," You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill."," All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?"," The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge."," Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?"," They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week."," Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!"," I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet."," We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?"," Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?"," The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir."," Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?"," The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m."," Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks."," Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded."," I need to get a taxi."," No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi."," Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel."," Just a taxi, please."," And what is your destination?"," I'm going to Rockefeller Center."," I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?"," I want to leave as soon as possible."," Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir."," Thank you, I'm coming down now."," It won't be but a few seconds, sir."," I need a taxi, please."," No, thanks. A taxi is just fine."," May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while."," I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you."," I understand. And where will you be going?"," Rockefeller Center."," And what time would you like to be picked up?"," The sooner the better."," A taxi will be here shortly, sir."," Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo."," A taxi it is, sir."," Can you get me a taxi?"," Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine."," In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style."," No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers."," Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?"," My destination is Rockefeller Center."," What time do you want to leave the hotel?"," As soon as possible."," I'll call the taxi immediately, sir."," I'm coming downstairs now."," A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir."," I'm going to need a taxi."," A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay."," Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi."," No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo."," No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?"," I'm headed to Rockefeller Center."," When shall I tell the taxi to be here?"," Right now."," The taxi will be here immediately, sir."," Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute."," You won't have to wait a second, sir."," I need a taxi."," We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer."," No, the taxi will do."," Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine."," No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine."," No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?"," I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center."," What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?"," I'm ready to go right now."," I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir."," Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs."," You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir."," Could you please reserve a taxi for me?"," Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?"," A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one."," Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?"," T A X I, please."," A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? "," Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?"," A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir."," Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs."," The taxi will be ready when you are, sir."," I am checking out. Here is the key to my room."," Thanks."," If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?"," I want to check out. Here is my room key."," One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are."," Thanks."," May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?"," I'm leaving. Here is my key."," Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go."," Thank you very much."," Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?"," Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic."," I'm out of here. Here's my key."," I thank you."," I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir."," I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home."," My stay is over. Here's the key to my room."," Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir."," Many thanks."," I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir."," This visit is over for me. Here's your room key."," Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt."," And thanks to you."," I hope you'll visit us again, sir."," That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night."," Okay, let me see what I can do."," Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple."," Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed."," This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!"," I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters."," I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered."," Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching \"Titanic\" Monday night."," That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night."," Okay, sir, bear with me a moment."," Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word."," You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," I feel your pain, sir."," Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. "," I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here."," You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw."," Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched \"Titanic\" Monday evening."," The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night."," Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please."," I knew you'd see it my way."," Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill."," Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?"," Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer."," This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!"," If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way."," Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?"," Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching \"Titanic.\""," The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night."," Thank you for taking care of it so quickly."," You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!"," Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir."," Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!"," I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money."," Hmm. Your file shows that you watched \"Titanic\" Monday night."," Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert."," Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly."," When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge."," Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5."," Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?"," Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not."," I'm checking out in about half an hour."," Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir."," Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m."," My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?"," Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though."," Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment."," Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour."," I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes."," I'm ready when you are, sir."," Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York."," You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine."," A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?"," Let me think about this."," Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes."," Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?"," Just say the word, sir."," Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun."," I agree. The dew is still on the grass."," Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?"," Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit."," I'll have to think about this for a second."," Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away."," In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour."," That won't be a problem, sir."," That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me."," You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you."," We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit."," A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit."," Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems."," That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute."," Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time."," I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes."," Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you."," Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," There's nothing like getting an early start, sir."," What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?"," You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit."," Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?"," I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card."," It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. "," I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?"," All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up."," All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?"," That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!"," I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?"," That sounds great, sir. Thank you."," Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?"," How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?"," Perfect. Thank you for doing that."," No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by."," I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you."," Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you."," A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?"," Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you."," I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. "," Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home."," You're welcome."," I need to cancel my reservation. I have personal matters that need fixing."," Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, April 9 through 15."," Thank you. I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother."," It's a pleasure."," I made a reservation earlier this week, but I have to cancel it."," That was nice and fast. Thanks."," Not at all."," All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date."," Thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can."," It's been my pleasure to help you."," My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made."," I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth."," I wish everything in life was so simple, thank you."," Not a problem, sir.

So where should I start my sightseeing?"," The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin."," Hmm. What type of interests do you have?"," In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running."," Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?"," No, but I've heard a lot about both."," Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot."," I'm sure you'll have a good time there."," I was told to see you about going sightseeing."," It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service."," Concierge? Could you explain that to me?"," We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop."," Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?"," I would suggest the Statue of Liberty."," Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?"," Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?"," I really like to run. And I like art."," No, but I've been meaning to."," That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that."," Enjoy your run and your visit!"," I need some sightseeing advice."," That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me."," I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?"," That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?"," I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty."," You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?"," Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time."," When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums."," No, but I sure would like to."," Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today."," Enjoy the views at both places."," I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first."," Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word."," That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?"," I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else."," Sure! Tell me about your interests."," I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters."," No, I just haven't had the opportunity."," Thank you. That's what I'll do."," This might be the best day of your visit."," I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you."," As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir."," Concierge? Are we speaking English here?"," What would you suggest that I visit first?"," I think so. Tell me what interests you."," I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running."," No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them."," Thank you. That's great advice."," This might be the best day of your visit."," Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? "," What in the world is a concierge?"," Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?"," Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?"," I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?"," I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums."," No, although I've heard great things about both of them."," Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here."," This is a day you're going to remember for a long time."," I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan."," Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?"," No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?"," As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there."," Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?"," Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?"," My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best."," That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?"," Of course, sir. You've made a good choice."," I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?"," She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her."," I'm already dialing, sir."," But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?"," She deserves nothing but the best, of course."," Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time."," My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?"," She will want an excellent restaurant, of course."," I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?"," At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you."," Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!"," Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge."," I'd like to order dinner."," What would you like?"," I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do."," And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," That's fine."," It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir."," Could I order dinner?"," Of course. What would you like?"," I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay."," Not tonight, thank you."," No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay."," Charge it to whatever account you like."," Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!"," Could you bring me some food, please?"," Sure. What do you fancy?"," No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then."," Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion."," Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?"," No problem."," Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it."," I'd like you to bring me some food."," Just name it, sir."," Sure, I love porterhouse, too."," I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries."," Go right ahead."," Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible."," I need something to eat, please."," Tell me what you're hungry for."," I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too."," Just the champagne will be fine, thank you."," You'll see this charge on your amenities account."," That's fine."," It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it."," Can I order something from the kitchen?"," Just tell me what you'd like, please."," Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!"," Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? "," Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. "," Not a problem."," I have a little problem with room 507."," What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?"," I found cockroaches in my room."," Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable."," I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room."," Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?"," I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room."," What is that problem, sir?"," There are cockroaches in my room."," Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?"," Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel."," You dare to doubt me?"," I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor."," There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507."," Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?"," I have cockroaches crawling in my room."," Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir."," I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see."," Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?"," How dare you question my statement!"," There's a major problem with room 507."," I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem."," This room is overrun with cockroaches."," There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir."," I stopped counting at nine."," I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. "," I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir."," Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches."," Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check."," The next cockroach I see will be number ten."," Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach."," I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!"," You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor."," I have a little problem with room 507."," Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem."," This room is filthy with cockroaches. "," Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?"," I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! "," Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots."," You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!"," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," And the problem is, sir?"," Cockroaches have taken over my room!"," Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others."," We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible."," I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight."," I'm sorry, sir. Exactly what is the problem?"," I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact."," Sir, we always try to please our guests."," I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight."," Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is."," I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!"," Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court."," Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy."," Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?"," I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!"," Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience."," Sir, our guests are our reason for being."," Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir."," In a word, cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars."," Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing."," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful."," Cockroaches have declared war on my room!"," Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do."," Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness."," Where is your fitness facility located?"," Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?"," What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?"," The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day."," Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?"," Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym."," Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness."," Great! Where is it?"," Do I have to pay extra?"," No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in."," What are the gym hours?"," You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7."," Great! Is a trainer available?"," Does this hotel have an exercise facility?"," But of course! We have a great exercise facility."," Good. Now exactly where is it?"," Is this going to cost me anything?"," When does the gym open and close?"," The hours couldn't be better, 24/7."," Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there?"," I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't."," Do you have a place where I can exercise?"," Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility."," I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is?"," Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?"," And the gym hours are?"," Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes."," One more question: Do you have a trainer?"," We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no."," Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?"," Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory."," So, where do I go to exercise?"," It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs."," Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?"," Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key."," Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?"," Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week."," Do you have a trainer to help me work out?"," I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer."," I'd like to request some more amenities."," Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?"," The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc."," I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?"," Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days."," Then what is the problem, sir?"," I need some to keep as souvenirs!"," Souvenirs?"," Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!"," We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir."," That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!"," I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly."," I need more amenities, please."," Could you be a little more specific, sir?"," To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo."," No! I've got all I need for my stay here."," So, what's the problem?"," I need souvenirs!"," You want some souvenirs!"," Yes, yes. Souvenirs."," But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items."," How do I get more amenities?"," I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand."," I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities."," No, no. I've got plenty left."," Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?"," What am I going to do about souvenirs?"," Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!"," Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs."," Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs."," Yes, I need more amenities."," By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?"," You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo."," Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?"," No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day."," I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?"," I need to take home some souvenirs!"," Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!"," Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection."," Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?"," I need some more amenities, please."," I'm not sure I'm following you, sir."," Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?"," No, I'm not even halfway through my supply."," I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?"," What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?"," Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!"," There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs."," Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items."," Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily."," I need to copy a document immediately."," We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor."," Great! How much is it for a copy?"," The price per copy is ten cents."," That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately."," THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir."," I need to copy something right now."," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir."," Great! How much per copy?"," Sir, one copy is ten cents."," I'll be down there shortly."," You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir."," I need to make a copy of something at once."," There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir."," Fantastic! Is there a charge?"," It's ten cents a copy, sir."," I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it."," A dime is still a bargain, sir."," I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible."," No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab."," Very good. How much does each copy cost?"," Each copy will cost you a dime, sir."," A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel."," There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir."," Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?"," Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. "," That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? "," Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. "," In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down."," Those were the good old days, sir, indeed."," I need a doctor immediately!"," Sir, is everything all right?"," My wife just collapsed on the floor!"," Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths."," I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room."," Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line."," What's taking you so long?"," I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm."," Help me! I need a doctor!"," What is the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor!"," Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath."," I need some help, right now!"," Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911."," Hurry, please!"," I'm transferring you right now, sir."," I need a doctor right now!"," Tell me the problem, sir."," My wife just passed out!"," Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!"," I'm getting 911 on another line, sir."," Okay, but hurry."," Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly."," Get a doctor here, immediately!"," What's the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!"," Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?"," Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!"," Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911."," Hurry up, please."," I'm connecting you now, sir."," A doctor! I need a doctor! "," Give me some details, sir."," Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor."," Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. "," You're right, I'm beside myself with worry."," Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911."," Time is critical. Hurry up!"," I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911."," I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop."," That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them."," Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives."," We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor."," Very good. How much does that cost?"," I see. And the other alternatives?"," Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?"," You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."," I need broadband for my computer."," That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only."," Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested."," Go ahead. I'm all ears."," We have a computer lab on the first floor."," That's great! How much is it?"," It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course."," What about the other alternatives?"," You could use your wireless right here in our lobby."," Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?"," Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab."," I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband."," I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only."," That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have."," Any alternative that works will be great."," Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor."," That sounds good. What's the charge?"," That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?"," I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup."," In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives."," Anything to get me up and running."," For starters, we have a computer lab."," Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?"," That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives."," Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?"," Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs."," How do I get online with my laptop?"," I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only."," No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives."," Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. "," Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor."," Great! But is it free?"," You said there were other alternatives?"," Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless."," I'd like to order a restock on my minibar."," You finished everything in there, sir?"," Absolutely everything. "," What would you like to order?"," Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," Uh-huh. What else do you want?"," The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?"," No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?"," Some grape juice would also be nice."," I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly."," I need my minibar restocked."," Everything is gone, sir?"," There's not a drop left of anything."," Is there anything in particular you'd like?"," Got it. Anything else?"," I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please."," Not a problem. Anything else?"," Yes, one more thing: some grape juice."," Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir."," My minibar is empty."," You already finished off everything, sir?"," I finished off everything."," Would you like anything in particular?"," The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each."," Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?"," I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please."," Sure thing. Might there by anything else?"," Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too."," How do I restock my minibar?"," You've drunk everything, sir?"," I finished it all."," Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?"," Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?"," The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please."," Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?"," You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too."," Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door."," My minibar is completely empty."," Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?"," Everything's gone. "," Is there anything special you'd like?"," Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier."," Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?"," The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please."," Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?"," Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice."," Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir."," Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?"," What exactly does that mean?"," That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?"," If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations."," Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?"," I'll go down there as soon as I can!"," Does this hotel have a pool?"," I'm not sure I understand."," Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current."," Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?"," Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations."," Excellent! Now what are the hours?"," The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only."," I'm going to change into my trunks right now!"," I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout."," Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?"," We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym."," I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?"," It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against."," Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?"," As a guest, sir, you pay nothing."," This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?"," Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!"," I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here."," This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?"," You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill."," All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?"," The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge."," Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?"," They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week."," Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!"," I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet."," We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?"," Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?"," The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir."," Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?"," The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m."," Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks."," Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded."," I need to get a taxi."," No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi."," Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel."," Just a taxi, please."," And what is your destination?"," I'm going to Rockefeller Center."," I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?"," I want to leave as soon as possible."," Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir."," Thank you, I'm coming down now."," It won't be but a few seconds, sir."," I need a taxi, please."," No, thanks. A taxi is just fine."," May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while."," I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you."," I understand. And where will you be going?"," Rockefeller Center."," And what time would you like to be picked up?"," The sooner the better."," A taxi will be here shortly, sir."," Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo."," A taxi it is, sir."," Can you get me a taxi?"," Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine."," In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style."," No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers."," Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?"," My destination is Rockefeller Center."," What time do you want to leave the hotel?"," As soon as possible."," I'll call the taxi immediately, sir."," I'm coming downstairs now."," A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir."," I'm going to need a taxi."," A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay."," Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi."," No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo."," No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?"," I'm headed to Rockefeller Center."," When shall I tell the taxi to be here?"," Right now."," The taxi will be here immediately, sir."," Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute."," You won't have to wait a second, sir."," I need a taxi."," We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer."," No, the taxi will do."," Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine."," No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine."," No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?"," I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center."," What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?"," I'm ready to go right now."," I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir."," Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs."," You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir."," Could you please reserve a taxi for me?"," Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?"," A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one."," Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?"," T A X I, please."," A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? "," Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?"," A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir."," Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs."," The taxi will be ready when you are, sir."," I am checking out. Here is the key to my room."," Thanks."," If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?"," I want to check out. Here is my room key."," One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are."," Thanks."," May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?"," I'm leaving. Here is my key."," Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go."," Thank you very much."," Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?"," Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic."," I'm out of here. Here's my key."," I thank you."," I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir."," I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home."," My stay is over. Here's the key to my room."," Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir."," Many thanks."," I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir."," This visit is over for me. Here's your room key."," Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt."," And thanks to you."," I hope you'll visit us again, sir."," That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night."," Okay, let me see what I can do."," Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple."," Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed."," This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!"," I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters."," I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered."," Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching \"Titanic\" Monday night."," That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night."," Okay, sir, bear with me a moment."," Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word."," You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," I feel your pain, sir."," Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. "," I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here."," You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw."," Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched \"Titanic\" Monday evening."," The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night."," Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please."," I knew you'd see it my way."," Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill."," Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?"," Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer."," This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!"," If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way."," Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?"," Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching \"Titanic.\""," The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night."," Thank you for taking care of it so quickly."," You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!"," Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir."," Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!"," I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money."," Hmm. Your file shows that you watched \"Titanic\" Monday night."," Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert."," Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly."," When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge."," Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5."," Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?"," Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not."," I'm checking out in about half an hour."," Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir."," Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m."," My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?"," Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though."," Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment."," Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour."," I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes."," I'm ready when you are, sir."," Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York."," You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine."," A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?"," Let me think about this."," Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes."," Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?"," Just say the word, sir."," Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun."," I agree. The dew is still on the grass."," Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?"," Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit."," I'll have to think about this for a second."," Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away."," In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour."," That won't be a problem, sir."," That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me."," You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you."," We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit."," A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit."," Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems."," That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute."," Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time."," I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes."," Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you."," Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," There's nothing like getting an early start, sir."," What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?"," You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit."," Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?"," I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card."," It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. "," I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?"," All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up."," All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?"," That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!"," I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?"," That sounds great, sir. Thank you."," Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?"," How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?"," Perfect. Thank you for doing that."," No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by."," I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you."," Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you."," A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?"," Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you."," I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. "," Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home."," You're welcome."," I need to cancel my reservation. I have personal matters that need fixing."," Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, April 9 through 15."," Thank you. I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother."," It's a pleasure."," I made a reservation earlier this week, but I have to cancel it."," That was nice and fast. Thanks."," Not at all."," All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date."," Thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can."," It's been my pleasure to help you."," My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made."," I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth."," I wish everything in life was so simple, thank you."," Not a problem, sir.

"," We're here all night long if you need anything."," The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice."," Concierge? What exactly is that?"," Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?"," The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin."," Hmm. What type of interests do you have?"," In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running."," Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?"," No, but I've heard a lot about both."," Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot."," I'm sure you'll have a good time there."," I was told to see you about going sightseeing."," It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service."," Concierge? Could you explain that to me?"," We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop."," Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?"," I would suggest the Statue of Liberty."," Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?"," Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?"," I really like to run. And I like art."," No, but I've been meaning to."," That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that."," Enjoy your run and your visit!"," I need some sightseeing advice."," That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me."," I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?"," That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?"," I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty."," You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?"," Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time."," When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums."," No, but I sure would like to."," Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today."," Enjoy the views at both places."," I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first."," Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word."," That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?"," I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else."," Sure! Tell me about your interests."," I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters."," No, I just haven't had the opportunity."," Thank you. That's what I'll do."," This might be the best day of your visit."," I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you."," As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir."," Concierge? Are we speaking English here?"," What would you suggest that I visit first?"," I think so. Tell me what interests you."," I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running."," No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them."," Thank you. That's great advice."," This might be the best day of your visit."," Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? "," What in the world is a concierge?"," Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?"," Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?"," I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?"," I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums."," No, although I've heard great things about both of them."," Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here."," This is a day you're going to remember for a long time."," I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan."," Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?"," No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?"," As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there."," Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?"," Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?"," My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best."," That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?"," Of course, sir. You've made a good choice."," I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?"," She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her."," I'm already dialing, sir."," But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?"," She deserves nothing but the best, of course."," Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time."," My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?"," She will want an excellent restaurant, of course."," I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?"," At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you."," Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!"," Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge."," I'd like to order dinner."," What would you like?"," I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do."," And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," That's fine."," It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir."," Could I order dinner?"," Of course. What would you like?"," I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay."," Not tonight, thank you."," No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay."," Charge it to whatever account you like."," Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!"," Could you bring me some food, please?"," Sure. What do you fancy?"," No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then."," Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?"," Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion."," Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?"," No problem."," Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it."," I'd like you to bring me some food."," Just name it, sir."," Sure, I love porterhouse, too."," I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries."," Go right ahead."," Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible."," I need something to eat, please."," Tell me what you're hungry for."," I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare."," I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too."," Just the champagne will be fine, thank you."," You'll see this charge on your amenities account."," That's fine."," It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it."," Can I order something from the kitchen?"," Just tell me what you'd like, please."," Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!"," Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? "," Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. "," Not a problem."," I have a little problem with room 507."," What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?"," I found cockroaches in my room."," Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable."," I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room."," Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?"," I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room."," What is that problem, sir?"," There are cockroaches in my room."," Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?"," Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel."," You dare to doubt me?"," I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor."," There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507."," Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?"," I have cockroaches crawling in my room."," Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir."," I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see."," Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?"," How dare you question my statement!"," There's a major problem with room 507."," I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem."," This room is overrun with cockroaches."," There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir."," I stopped counting at nine."," I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor."," I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. "," I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir."," Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches."," Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check."," The next cockroach I see will be number ten."," Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach."," I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!"," You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor."," I have a little problem with room 507."," Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem."," This room is filthy with cockroaches. "," Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?"," I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! "," Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots."," You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!"," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," And the problem is, sir?"," Cockroaches have taken over my room!"," Thank you. I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others."," We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible."," I want to change rooms immediately, plus a refund for tonight."," I'm sorry, sir. Exactly what is the problem?"," I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact."," Sir, we always try to please our guests."," I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight."," Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is."," I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!"," Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court."," Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy."," Would you please tell me the exact problem, sir?"," I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches!"," Thank you very much. This has been a most unsettling experience."," Sir, our guests are our reason for being."," Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem, sir."," In a word, cockroaches!"," Thank you. I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars."," Sir, without happy guests, we are nothing."," I want to change rooms. In fact, I want a refund for tonight!"," If you tell me the exact problem, I can be more helpful."," Cockroaches have declared war on my room!"," Sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do."," Excuse me. Does this hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons, including fitness."," Where is your fitness facility located?"," Is there an additional surcharge for the gym?"," What time is the gym open, and what time does it close?"," The gym is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day."," Do you offer trainer services along with the gym?"," Unfortunately, no. If you want a trainer, you'll have to use another gym."," Pardon me. Does your hotel have a fitness facility?"," Yes, sir. We try to anticipate all our guests' needs, including fitness."," Great! Where is it?"," Do I have to pay extra?"," No, sir. It's gratis. Just take your room key so you can get in."," What are the gym hours?"," You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7."," Great! Is a trainer available?"," Does this hotel have an exercise facility?"," But of course! We have a great exercise facility."," Good. Now exactly where is it?"," Is this going to cost me anything?"," When does the gym open and close?"," The hours couldn't be better, 24/7."," Very good. Now, is there a trainer down there?"," I wish I could tell you yes, but no, there isn't."," Do you have a place where I can exercise?"," Yes, sir. We have a fine exercise facility."," I'm happy to hear that. Now, would you tell me where it is?"," Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?"," And the gym hours are?"," Sir, you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes."," One more question: Do you have a trainer?"," We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, no."," Excuse me. Do you happen to have a gym here?"," Yes, sir. I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory."," So, where do I go to exercise?"," It's only one flight down, sir. Just take the elevator or the stairs."," Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?"," Sir, you can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key."," Great! Now tell me, what are the hours of this gym?"," Sir, our gym is open around the clock, every day of the week."," Do you have a trainer to help me work out?"," I'm sorry, sir, but we have no trainer."," I'd like to request some more amenities."," Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?"," The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc."," I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?"," Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days."," Then what is the problem, sir?"," I need some to keep as souvenirs!"," Souvenirs?"," Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!"," We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir."," That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!"," I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly."," I need more amenities, please."," Could you be a little more specific, sir?"," To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo."," No! I've got all I need for my stay here."," So, what's the problem?"," I need souvenirs!"," You want some souvenirs!"," Yes, yes. Souvenirs."," But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items."," How do I get more amenities?"," I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand."," I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities."," No, no. I've got plenty left."," Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?"," What am I going to do about souvenirs?"," Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!"," Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs."," Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs."," Yes, I need more amenities."," By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?"," You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo."," Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?"," No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day."," I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?"," I need to take home some souvenirs!"," Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!"," Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection."," Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?"," I need some more amenities, please."," I'm not sure I'm following you, sir."," Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo."," Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?"," No, I'm not even halfway through my supply."," I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?"," What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?"," Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!"," There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs."," Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items."," Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily."," I need to copy a document immediately."," We have a copy machine in our computer lab, located on the first floor."," Great! How much is it for a copy?"," The price per copy is ten cents."," That sounds reasonable. I'll be down there immediately."," THere shouldn't be any long lines, sir."," I need to copy something right now."," Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir."," Great! How much per copy?"," Sir, one copy is ten cents."," I'll be down there shortly."," You probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir."," I need to make a copy of something at once."," There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab, sir."," Fantastic! Is there a charge?"," It's ten cents a copy, sir."," I'm only making one copy, so I guess I can afford it."," A dime is still a bargain, sir."," I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible."," No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab."," Very good. How much does each copy cost?"," Each copy will cost you a dime, sir."," A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel."," There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir."," Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?"," Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab. "," That's great. I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests? "," Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer. "," In the good old days, it was only five cents a copy. I'll be right down."," Those were the good old days, sir, indeed."," I need a doctor immediately!"," Sir, is everything all right?"," My wife just collapsed on the floor!"," Sir, I need you to calm down. Take deep breaths."," I'm sorry. It's just that my wife. I need the emergency room."," Sir, I'm dialing 911 on another line."," What's taking you so long?"," I'm transferring you right now. Just remain calm."," Help me! I need a doctor!"," What is the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor!"," Sir, please calm down. Take a deep breath."," I need some help, right now!"," Sir, I'm going to put you through to 911."," Hurry, please!"," I'm transferring you right now, sir."," I need a doctor right now!"," Tell me the problem, sir."," My wife just passed out!"," Don't tell me to calm down! My wife is passed out!"," I'm getting 911 on another line, sir."," Okay, but hurry."," Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly."," Get a doctor here, immediately!"," What's the problem, sir?"," My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!"," Sir, could you calm down a little bit, please?"," Calm down?! My wife is unconscious, and you're telling me to calm down?!"," Hold on just a second, sir. I'm dialing 911."," Hurry up, please."," I'm connecting you now, sir."," A doctor! I need a doctor! "," Give me some details, sir."," Something is wrong with my wife. She's lying on the floor."," Sir, if you don't calm down, you might have a stroke yourself. "," You're right, I'm beside myself with worry."," Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911."," Time is critical. Hurry up!"," I hope everything turns out well, sir. Here's 911."," I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop."," That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them."," Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives."," We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor."," Very good. How much does that cost?"," I see. And the other alternatives?"," Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?"," You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."," I need broadband for my computer."," That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only."," Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested."," Go ahead. I'm all ears."," We have a computer lab on the first floor."," That's great! How much is it?"," It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course."," What about the other alternatives?"," You could use your wireless right here in our lobby."," Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?"," Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab."," I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband."," I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only."," That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have."," Any alternative that works will be great."," Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor."," That sounds good. What's the charge?"," That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?"," I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup."," In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives."," Anything to get me up and running."," For starters, we have a computer lab."," Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?"," That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives."," Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?"," Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs."," How do I get online with my laptop?"," I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only."," No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives."," Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. "," Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor."," Great! But is it free?"," You said there were other alternatives?"," Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless."," I'd like to order a restock on my minibar."," You finished everything in there, sir?"," Absolutely everything. "," What would you like to order?"," Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," Uh-huh. What else do you want?"," The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?"," No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?"," Some grape juice would also be nice."," I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly."," I need my minibar restocked."," Everything is gone, sir?"," There's not a drop left of anything."," Is there anything in particular you'd like?"," Got it. Anything else?"," I really liked the apples. Bring me a couple of apples, please."," Not a problem. Anything else?"," Yes, one more thing: some grape juice."," Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir."," My minibar is empty."," You already finished off everything, sir?"," I finished off everything."," Would you like anything in particular?"," The Perrier and the Jim Beam. Let me have three more of each."," Beam and Perrier. Anything else, sir?"," I really loved the apples in my room. Bring me a few more, please."," Sure thing. Might there by anything else?"," Yes, speaking of fruit, bring me some grape juice, too."," How do I restock my minibar?"," You've drunk everything, sir?"," I finished it all."," Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?"," Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam."," That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir?"," The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please."," Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?"," You know, some grape juice would be really nice, too."," Be patient for just a few minutes, sir, and someone will be at your door."," My minibar is completely empty."," Everything in that minibar has been consumed, sir?"," Everything's gone. "," Is there anything special you'd like?"," Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier."," Okay, sir. Three of each. Would you like anything else?"," The fruit basket was great. I need a few more apples, please."," Perrier, Jim Beam, and apples. Is that it for now?"," Yes, one last thing: I could use some grape juice."," Your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir."," Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?"," What exactly does that mean?"," That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?"," If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations."," Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?"," I'll go down there as soon as I can!"," Does this hotel have a pool?"," I'm not sure I understand."," Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current."," Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?"," Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations."," Excellent! Now what are the hours?"," The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only."," I'm going to change into my trunks right now!"," I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout."," Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?"," We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym."," I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?"," It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against."," Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?"," As a guest, sir, you pay nothing."," This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?"," Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!"," I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here."," This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?"," You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill."," All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?"," The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge."," Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?"," They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week."," Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!"," I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet."," We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym."," Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?"," Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?"," The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir."," Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?"," The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m."," Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks."," Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded."," I need to get a taxi."," No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi."," Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel."," Just a taxi, please."," And what is your destination?"," I'm going to Rockefeller Center."," I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?"," I want to leave as soon as possible."," Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir."," Thank you, I'm coming down now."," It won't be but a few seconds, sir."," I need a taxi, please."," No, thanks. A taxi is just fine."," May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while."," I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you."," I understand. And where will you be going?"," Rockefeller Center."," And what time would you like to be picked up?"," The sooner the better."," A taxi will be here shortly, sir."," Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo."," A taxi it is, sir."," Can you get me a taxi?"," Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine."," In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style."," No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers."," Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?"," My destination is Rockefeller Center."," What time do you want to leave the hotel?"," As soon as possible."," I'll call the taxi immediately, sir."," I'm coming downstairs now."," A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir."," I'm going to need a taxi."," A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay."," Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi."," No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo."," No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?"," I'm headed to Rockefeller Center."," When shall I tell the taxi to be here?"," Right now."," The taxi will be here immediately, sir."," Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute."," You won't have to wait a second, sir."," I need a taxi."," We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer."," No, the taxi will do."," Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine."," No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine."," No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?"," I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center."," What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?"," I'm ready to go right now."," I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir."," Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs."," You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir."," Could you please reserve a taxi for me?"," Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?"," A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one."," Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?"," T A X I, please."," A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? "," Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?"," A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir."," Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs."," The taxi will be ready when you are, sir."," I am checking out. Here is the key to my room."," Thanks."," If you don't mind me asking, how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?"," I want to check out. Here is my room key."," One second, sir, while I print out your receipt. Here you are."," Thanks."," May I ask, sir, if you enjoyed your stay?"," I'm leaving. Here is my key."," Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go."," Thank you very much."," Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?"," Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic."," I'm out of here. Here's my key."," I thank you."," I hope you enjoyed your stay, sir."," I apologize again for the cockroaches, sir. I hope you have a nice trip home."," My stay is over. Here's the key to my room."," Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir."," Many thanks."," I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir."," This visit is over for me. Here's your room key."," Thank you for that, and in return, here's your receipt."," And thanks to you."," I hope you'll visit us again, sir."," That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night."," Okay, let me see what I can do."," Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple."," Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed."," This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!"," I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters."," I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered."," Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching \"Titanic\" Monday night."," That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night."," Okay, sir, bear with me a moment."," Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word."," You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?"," I feel your pain, sir."," Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. "," I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here."," You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw."," Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched \"Titanic\" Monday evening."," The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night."," Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please."," I knew you'd see it my way."," Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill."," Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?"," Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer."," This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!"," If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way."," Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?"," Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching \"Titanic.\""," The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night."," Thank you for taking care of it so quickly."," You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!"," Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir."," Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!"," I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money."," Hmm. Your file shows that you watched \"Titanic\" Monday night."," Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert."," Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly."," When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge."," Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5."," Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?"," Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not."," I'm checking out in about half an hour."," Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir."," Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m."," My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?"," Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though."," Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment."," Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour."," I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes."," I'm ready when you are, sir."," Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York."," You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine."," A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?"," Let me think about this."," Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes."," Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?"," Just say the word, sir."," Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun."," I agree. The dew is still on the grass."," Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?"," Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit."," I'll have to think about this for a second."," Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away."," In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour."," That won't be a problem, sir."," That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me."," You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you."," We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit."," A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit."," Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems."," That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute."," Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time."," I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes."," Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you."," Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun."," There's nothing like getting an early start, sir."," What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?"," You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit."," Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?"," I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card."," It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. "," I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?"," All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up."," All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?"," That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!"," I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?"," That sounds great, sir. Thank you."," Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?"," How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?"," Perfect. Thank you for doing that."," No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by."," I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you."," Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you."," A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?"," Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you."," I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week. "," Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home."," You're welcome."," I need to cancel my reservation. I have personal matters that need fixing."," Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234, April 9 through 15."," Thank you. I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother."," It's a pleasure."," I made a reservation earlier this week, but I have to cancel it."," That was nice and fast. Thanks."," Not at all."," All I need is your name, phone, and reservation date."," Thank you. I'll make another reservation as soon as I can."," It's been my pleasure to help you."," My wife is sick, so I have to cancel a reservation I made."," I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234, April ninth to the fifteenth."," I wish everything in life was so simple, thank you."," Not a problem, sir.
